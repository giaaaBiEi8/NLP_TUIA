Gardeners tend the pond, where the koi carp live, warriors stand guard on the walls, and courtiers crowd the gates, pining for an audience that brings them closer to the innermost circles of the court. When night falls, the lanterns are lit and the workers return to their clan.\n",
            "In The White Castle, players will control one of these clans in order to score more victory points than the rest. To do so, they must amass influence in the court, manage resources boldly, and place their workers in the right place at the right time. [In this game, you will] explore the most imposing fortress in modern Japan, Himeji Castle, where the banner of the Sakai clan flies under the orders of Daimio Sakai Tadakiyo.\n",
            "The White Castle is a Euro type game with mechanics of resource management, worker placement and dice placement to carry out actions. During the game, over three rounds, players will send members of their clan to tend the gardens, defend the castle or progress up the social ladder of the nobility. At the end of the match, these will award players victory points in a variety of ways.\n",
            "\n",
            "To set up the game, place the board on the table – you can see the three level castle in the middle surrounded by other features.  Shuffle the appropriate decks of cards and place 1 grey Daimyo card, 2 blue Diplomat cards and 3 yellow Steward cards in the castle.  Also put out 2 Garden cards and 4 Yard tiles in their places. Colored die tiles are placed next to all of the actions in an area, taking care to make sure each area has at least two different colors shown.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Time markers are placed on the Passage of Time track; there are four sections here, each representing a season.  Note that in order to move into the next season, you have to pay a cost in Daimyo seals as shown on the track.  Each player also puts a marker near the start of the Clan Points track.\n",
            "Roll the dice of the three colors (5 dice in a 4p game) and then place them in ascending order from left to right on the matching color bridge.  Each player gets a personal board with all 15 wooden clan pieces in the right spots. The 3 resource cubes are put on their tracks on the 0 space – gray iron, yellow food, white mother-of-pearl.  Player markers are stacked on the turn order track.  A market of starting Resource and Action cards is made so that there are N+1 pairs of cards.\n",
            "The game will be played over 3 rounds, and in each of those three rounds, players will get 3 turns each.  In each turn, a player will take a valid die from a Bridge and place it on an area with a die symbol and then apply the associated action.  Dice can be taken from any of the three bridges, but you must take from the very left or right of the line; that is the current highest or lowest number of that color.  If you choose the left die, you will get a Lantern bonus.  When you place it on an action space, if the die is higher than the number shown, you gain coins equal to the difference.  If the die is lower than the number shown, you must pay the difference.  Further, on the main board, you can stack a die on top of a previously placed die – again getting/paying coins for the difference.  There is a maximum of 2-high on the stacking.\n",

            "After three turns have been played, the round ends.  There will be three dice left on the Bridges.  First, set the turn order.  The player who is furthest on the Passage of Time track goes first; rearrange the turn order markers appropriately.  Now, you activate the gardens, if there is at least one die left on a particular bridge, all of the Gardener tokens directly beneath it are activated and they get to perform the action of the space they are on.  When this is done, collect all the dice, reroll them and place them on the bridges to start the next round.\n",

            "My thoughts on the game\n",
            "The White Castle is a very tight game where every action has a large impact on your overall performance.  You essentially only get 9 turns each game, so you want to try to do something useful with each and every one – and let me tell you, that’s not an easy task!   In this game, all of the major mechanisms intertwine in a way that as you progress in one area, you gain some benefits towards the other actions – but of course, those actions require different resources than what you were collecting in the first place!\n",
            "The player board and the wooden figures exemplify this intertwining.  As you place more gardeners, you will open production spaces for iron – the resource used to place warriors.  And as you place warriors, you will make more mother-of-pearl, which is what you need to place Courtiers.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The board is pretty, but quite busy. There are a lot of things on the board, many of which change (cards, chits, etc).  All the information is there, but man, it can be hard to find.  The icons are at least consistent, and they are helpfully summarized on the back page of the rules – so it’s easy to look up anything that isn’t immediately evident.  I feel like this sort of board is a DEVIR want – it reminds me a lot of the Bitoku board which also had lots and lots of spaces, icons and beautiful background art.  (3 Ring Circus is another recent release which has a busy board, but not quite as visually confusing as this one.)\n",
            "\n",
            "Ergonomically, everything works, but the busy background art does sometimes make it hard to pick out the actual game details that you need to play the game correctly.  Also, while beautiful, we have had some gamers confused on the garden cards – there really should be a line on the medial edges of the cards to make it clear that there are two separate action spots under each bridge, not just one large one – if that is in fact the case (and it is, confirmed by one of the designers); the player aid shows an icon which makes me think that maybe you’re supposed to get both halves of the garden area?  I also wish the Courtier action reminded you that you got to do two actions as we missed that in our first game.  Yes, I must have misread the rules, but the way in which we interpreted the player aid didn’t help us figure it out.  Other OG writers have said they weren’t bothered by this, but I make mention here if nothing else to dispel possible confusion from anyone who reads this.\n",
            "The rules are dense, and like a few other Devir games, in an organization that confuses me.  The problem may not be the rules, as I’ve discussed the game with other friends, and only some had the same level of confusion as I did.   In our first game, we missed out on an important rule – you get a lantern bonus each time you take the lowest numbered die of a color.  Again, when you only have 9 turns, getting a lantern bonus is almost like getting a free action once you get two or three cards there.  \n",
            "So obviously our first game didn’t feel like it had enough actions.  We also missed the fact that you get to do two actions for each Courtier icon.  I would say that sometimes if everyone misses a rule (especially if a small one), it’s not a big deal as everyone might be equally disadvantaged – but here, with the paucity of actions, you really need/want to get every last drop of activity from your turn.  Playing the game again with the right rules really opened things up – as you would expect it to do.  But, I mention it here because we missed two pretty important rules in that first game.  Don’t make the same mistakes as I did!\n",
            "\n",
            "For me, in White Castle, the big challenge here is trying to set up an engine; though I wouldn’t go as far as calling this an engine building game…  You want to get a steady set of resource production / passage of time movement in your Lantern area.  Hopefully you’ll get to take advantage of this a few times over the course of a game.   Otherwise, you’ll need to scan the board to see where you can chain actions together.  The obvious place is Level 1 of the castle; if there is a room that has two actions with the same color die; then when you place that color die there – you can take both actions in either order.  The actual action selections will likely change as players move courtiers up the castle and collect cards for their Lantern bonus areas; but finding those places where you can do both is key.\n",
            "Later in the game, when you are planning to place a warrior, at least two of the yards will grant an extra action – so plan carefully to make sure you have enough resources to successfully perform whatever action you’ll get as a result of placement.\n",
            "When you’re done playing The White Castle, your brain will likely be a bit tired as there is a bunch of thinking going on here as you have so many different things to think about and such a set of actions to try to chain together in order to maximize your actions.  The game is a pretty intense 60-90 minutes, and with the right rules, a very tense puzzle that makes you think every step of the way.\n",
            "Provisional rating: I like it.  (I am waffling here because I maybe haven’t played it enough with the right rules to know what I really think about it, but I have been thinking a lot about the game and how to play it – and that’s a sure sign of a game I like).  \n",
            "Thoughts from other Opinionated Gamers\n",
            "Dan B. (2 plays): I think the game is decent, and trying to maximize the impact of your limited number of actions is an interesting puzzle. However, it is a bit overwrought for the effect – I am not convinced the extra complexity in this vs. something like The Red Cathedral really adds enough interest to be worth it. However, it’s still not that complex in an absolute sense and is certainly worth trying. (And for the record, no one I played with had any issue with the courtier action.)\n",
            "Ratings from the Opinionated Gamers\n",
            "Value. Value is largely subjective by nature- each of us places value on things to varying degrees and often the value we ascribe to those things in turn varies from person to person. Furthermore, one individual can find boundless value from a thing while another sees no value whatsoever in that same thing. Value can have any manner of adjectives placed before it to instill a more specific sense of the value trying to be communicated, such as monetary value, or, to actually bring it into the realm of games finally, play value. Now that I’ve likely bored you with describing something you already know (and have you wondering about the value of the point I’m even trying to get at), let me throw you a curveball, because I want to put forth the idea that some things are just so irrefutably good that their value could be considered objective rather than subjective by nature. That a thing can have impressive amounts of value across enough adjectives to cross over into objectivity. This is just my opinion, of course.\n",
            "The White Castle, designed by Llama Dice Games and published by Devir (the team that brought you Red Cathedral), is such a thing. At least I think so, and I’m going to tell you why.\n",
            "The titular White Castle\n",
            "First, let’s look at the mechanics and gameplay of this tight little mixture of dice placement, worker placement, and engine building, which may or may not surprise you is totally devoid of anything hamburger related. In fact, the setting of the famous Himeji Castle during the feudal era of Japan has very little bearing on the game, providing little beyond a patina of visual elegance. The framing does work, but some of the theme based iconography can be a bit to wrap your head around at first. The central mechanic of The White Castle is dice placement. During the three rounds of the game, three sets of different colors of dice are rolled and placed on the matching colored bridge in numerical order from lowest to highest. The amount of dice rolled is determined by the number of players, which guarantees that however many players there are, each one only gets three dice to place per round, leaving three dice on the bridges at the end of the round. Each player turn is determined by the color and number on the die placed, and different placements yield different bonuses, costs, worker placement action or a combination thereof.\n",
            "The Gardener at work\n",
            "There are three worker placement actions a die can activate, and each one represents an area of the board and a specific type of worker. The gardener action allows a player to place one of their gardener meeples on one of the six randomized garden cards placed near the bridges. This will always cost some amount of food (one of the three primary resources, counted on the player mat track, one for each area of the board), will trigger an action or grant resources, usually at an additional cost, and most importantly, scores additional points at the end of the game. If the final dice left at the end of a round are left in a space above an occupied garden, that player can activate the garden card’s ability again (Frankly, this didn’t happen as often as you might think). After several games of The White Castle at various player counts, it felt like this action was more situational than the other two, largely due to how expensive placing workers there could be. In games where the random setup elements provided for easy to acquire food and coin, they saw a lot more action. If food in particular was hard to come by, however, then those gardens were largely left untended.\n",
            "Courtiers maker their way up the castle\n",
            "The courtier action, on the other hand, became a vital part of a winning strategy in every game. Most of the board is taken up by the three levels of the castle and the castle gates, where courtier meeples start their journey upwards for two coins. Additional levels can be traversed for pearls, and the rooms in levels one and two have cards that indicate the action associated with the die slot to it’s left. Moving a courtier into that room lets the player claim it’s card and putting it in the card area on their player board (taking one action on the taken card for free), replacing the card that was there which now gets flipped over and added to the lantern action below (which is VERY good, more on that later). Get all the way to the top and you get to trigger a lantern action in addition to one of three choices on a card from another deck that was randomly selected during game setup. Each level yields progressively more points at the end of the game, even the gates!\n",
            "A Warrior enters the training ground\n",
            "Finally, the warrior action allows a player to place a warrior in one of the three training yards, costing two, three, or five iron respectively. Each of these spots has a randomly selected tile with an ability that gets activated when the warrior is placed there, with the most expensive yard having two such tiles. The utility of these three spaces can vary from game to game depending on which ability tiles come out, but the real reason to empty your board of warriors is that they act as multipliers at the end of the game for the number of courtiers in the castle. I found that focusing on the symbiosis of those two worker types lent itself to racking up huge points at the end of the game.\n",
            "\n",
            "All of the rest of the dice placement in the game yields resources, moves a player’s influence token further up the Passage of Time track (which determines player turn order each round), or triggers a Lantern Action. Even the player boards have die slots, one for each color, corresponding to the three rows of workers on the board, allowing for what is called a Personal Domain Action. As courtiers, warriors and gardeners are placed on the main board, resource icons are revealed. When a Personal Domain Action is taken, all of the revealed icons on the row yield the appropriate resources, and the action on the card at the end of the row is taken. How often this is done each game generally depends on the board state established during setup, so swapping out those cards by moving courtiers up the castle is potentially a game changer.\n",
            "\n",
            "I’ve already brought it up a few times, hinted at it, so let’s talk about one of my favorite parts of the game: the Lantern Action. There are two different ways to trigger the Lantern Action, and you can trigger it multiple times in a single turn. The most obvious way to trigger it is by placing a die that corresponds to the action on a card or on the board. The interesting way to trigger it is by taking a die on the left side of the bridge, often requiring a sacrifice when placing the die due to paying the value difference in coin rather than gaining it like a higher value die would. Now, at the beginning of the game, this is more like a nice little bonus, but as you move courtiers up the castle and claim cards, your current personal domain action card flips over and moves down to an ever growing Lantern Action, bringing you everything from resources, to influence, to coins, to points. Eventually you hit that one turn just right where you end up triggering the lantern two or three times and it’s like hitting a jackpot.\n",
            "\n",
            "It’s the capacity of chaining actions like that, and even the possibility of doing so in the early part of the game, where The White Castle really starts to shine. These chain reactions can go deep, and taking a one-and-done action feels like a missed opportunity in a game where each player only gets nine total turns. Conversely, when a single turn has you fiddling with nearly every corner of the game board, the resulting dopamine spike might just remind you why you got into this hobby in the first place.\n",
            "I’m going to let you in on a little secret- sometimes when reviewing a game, we reviewers will occasionally misread or omit a rule and play the game incorrectly a few times. Now, this is a problem if the mistakes are never caught or if the game is never played correctly, but more often it becomes an accidental blessing and underscores and reveals where some of the decision making involved led to the rules in question. The first three or four games I played of White Castle, each play had one small omission or misplay, and as I corrected with each consecutive play, layering in each missed rule, my opinion of the game went from “good” to “great”. When that final rules mistake got corrected, the quibbles and nitpicks I had (especially with how tight the game was and how badly I wished I had just one or two more turns) melted away, and the true balance of the game lay revealed to me. Now, I wouldn’t go so far as to say that the rules for the game are written poorly, but, like everything else in this tiny box, they are very dense.\n",
            "This player’s Lantern action is growing\n",
            "That so much game is packed into such a small box for such a low price is utterly refreshing in these days of cardboard crowdfunding excess. This $30 box is dense, has to be packed just so, and any thoughts of an organizer or room for an expansion are laughable at best.If the box was any smaller, I’d be wondering if it was a TARDIS. Component quality, much like the gameplay, presents as a much bigger more expensive game. Frankly, the whole package may be one of the best values I’ve seen in this hobby for years, and will likely land in my top five games of the year at this point.\n",

            "A tiny box with a ton of game, The White Castle is a tight yet satisfying mid-weight worker placement game with a ton of replayability. The combination of dice-placement and worker placement and the capacity to kick off chain reactions with wild abandon make this one of the best games in this class for years, and the small price tag just means there’s really no excuse to add it to your collection.

The example provided explains perfectly which garden cards score for which bridge.\\n\\nAFAIK the gardens are dealt randomly, so bridge order/color doesn’t really matter?\\nThe only connection between a bridge and the two gardens under it are for scoring at the end of a round. End of round is triggered when there are only three dice left. Only gardens under bridges with die/dice are scored.\\n\\nThat\\'s exactly my point, in the french rules they said to activate all the gardeners associate to the bridges with at least one die, but they never define what is \"associate\", is it adjacent? Under it ?\\nBut I\\'ve just checked in the English one and they use the term \"above\" which is a lot more clear.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe White Castle is the latest creation from Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero, the dynamic duo behind The Red Cathedral. This time, they’ve traded Moscow’s onion domes for Japan’s Himeji Castle, a fortress steeped in history and meticulously trimmed bonsai. Over nine turns (yes, only nine), players embody ambitious clans striving to impress Daimyo Sakai Tadakiyo. You’ll assign samurai, gardeners, and courtiers while managing resources, climbing the social ladder, and occasionally cursing your dice rolls.\\nAt first glance, it’s a serene, thematic eurogame. But don’t let the peaceful gardens fool you—this is a lean, unforgiving race for points that rewards precision and punishes inefficiency. Now let’s dismantle this castle brick by metaphorical brick.\\nMechanics – Zen Simplicity or Overengineered Puzzle?\\nThe game revolves around dice drafting and placement, and while the core mechanics are straightforward, the layers of interconnectivity turn every decision into a brain-bending conundrum. Let’s dive into the gears of this economic engine:\\nDice Drafting:\\nPlayers take dice from three bridges, each die determining action potency, associated costs, and potential rewards. High-value dice offer better actions and more money, but they’re pricier to use. Low-value dice activate your lantern bonus but may limit your immediate options. This mechanic creates a delicious tension between short-term gains and long-term efficiency. Or, if you roll poorly, just tension.\\n\\nWorker Placement:\\nWorkers — samurai, gardeners, and courtiers — can be deployed across several zones:\\nGardeners: Tend the pond and reactivate their actions at the end of every round. A gardener is basically the game’s overachiever who keeps doing their job even after clocking out.\\nCourtiers: Climb the social ranks inside the castle. Higher ranks yield better actions and endgame points, but it’s like trying to climb a corporate ladder in quicksand.\\nSamurai: Defend the castle’s walls, granting resources and minor bonuses—provided your courtiers aren’t slacking off, as samurai refuse to score if courtiers aren’t pulling their weight. (Union rules?)\\nLantern Bonuses and Combos: The game rewards players who plan ahead and create cascading actions. Place a die, trigger a worker, gain resources, and reposition another piece to unlock yet another action. It’s deeply satisfying when it works, and maddening when one misstep derails your carefully crafted Rube Goldberg machine.\\nNine Turns Only: Yes, you read that right. Nine. If brevity is the soul of wit, The White Castle is the Shakespearean sonnet of eurogames. Each turn carries immense weight, and there’s no room for dithering.\\n\\nStrategy – The Tightrope of Efficiency\\nWinning in The White Castle is a balancing act. Every decision feels monumental, and the wrong move can haunt you for the remaining eight turns. Here’s what works—and what doesn’t:\\nDice Dilemmas: Choosing the right die isn’t just a question of value; it’s about timing, positioning, and adaptability. The color determines what actions you can take, while the value influences cost and impact. It’s brilliant, but it also feels like playing chess with dice that occasionally call you stupid.\\nWorker Specialization: Each worker type has its niche, and focusing on the right one at the right time is critical. However, the game’s interconnected systems mean you can’t specialize without neglecting something else. It’s like trying to win a triathlon by only training for swimming.\\nCombo Actions: As the game progresses, opportunities for chain reactions increase, turning modest turns into explosive point-scoring festivals. But getting there requires early investment and razor-sharp foresight.\\nCastle Politics: Courtiers are the key to endgame scoring, but focusing on them too early can leave you resource-starved. Ignore them, however, and your samurai will sulk in the corner, refusing to score.\\n\\nComponents and Presentation – Minimalist Elegance Meets Functionality\\nThe production quality is impressive, with clean art, wooden components, and a thematic board layout. However, not everything is as polished as Himeji Castle’s immaculate walls.\\nBoard Design: The central board is visually stunning but occasionally overwhelming for new players. The muted palette, while thematic, sometimes sacrifices clarity for style.\\nDice and Tokens: The custom dice feel great to roll and handle. The wooden worker tokens are functional but lack the pizzazz of modern eurogame bling.\\nPlayer Boards: The individual player boards are well-designed and intuitive, making resource management straightforward—at least until you inevitably run out of resources and have to beg the well for scraps.\\nPlayer Interaction – Quietly Competitive Chaos\\nInteraction in The White Castle is subtle but impactful. It’s not about direct conflict; it’s about sneaking in and taking the die or spot your opponent desperately needed.\\nDice Drafting: Choosing dice is where most of the passive-aggressive action happens. Deny your opponents their optimal dice, and you’ll hear their quiet groans of despair echo across the table.\\nBoard Space Competition: Worker placement is tight, and the limited spaces on the board force players into constant jostling. Block someone’s ideal spot, and you’ve effectively derailed their turn without lifting a finger.\\nStrengths – Where The White Castle Shines\\nStrategic Depth: The interplay between dice, workers, and resources creates a rich tapestry of decisions, rewarding careful planning and adaptability.\\nPacing: With only nine turns, the game avoids overstaying its welcome, delivering a condensed yet satisfying eurogame experience.\\nReplayability: The dynamic setup, dice variability, and evolving combos ensure no two games feel alike.\\nAccessibility: Despite its depth, the rules are straightforward enough to make this a gateway-plus game for players looking to dive into heavier euros.\\nWeaknesses – Where the Foundation Cracks\\nLearning Curve: The interdependence of mechanics can be overwhelming for first-timers, leading to analysis paralysis and “oops” moments.\\nDice Luck: While the game offers mitigation strategies, bad rolls can still leave you with suboptimal options, especially in lower player counts.\\nThematic Disconnects: For a game set in feudal Japan, the mechanics feel more eurogame abstract than thematic immersion.\\nFinal Verdict: A Tightrope Walk of Strategy and Tension\\nThe White Castle is a masterclass in efficient eurogame design. It combines strategic depth with accessible mechanics, delivering a fast-paced, brain-burning experience. While it’s not without its flaws — particularly its dice luck and steep learning curve — it’s a game that rewards repeated plays and strategic mastery.\\n\\nExcellent review!  The White Castle is on my shelf of opportunity (or possibly on the floor near my shelf of opportunity), but I still like reading other people\\'s takes.  I\\'m excited to try it out.   I think my plan is to introduce it with a few of my friends who like games of this weight and learn and grow together.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring setup, normally you draw one random initial Resources card and one random initial Action. In this variant you do that twice to form two pairs, and choose which pair to start with.\\n\\nThis variant should be compatible with any other variants.\\nWhen reading the original rule, I wondered (and I still do) why it is ruled like that. I would\\'ve expected that, especially in the solo mode that has a beautiful puzzle element, it\\'d be nice to start the game with a choice, just like in the multiplayer game. I get that in a multiplayer game, the last player to choose one of two pairs gets the worst choice on average, while in my variant the solo player would get to choose between two random options, which are better on average. Though, given that many solo players find the easy solo mode very hard on their first plays, this variant probably isn\\'t a problem at all.\\nDisclaimer: I have yet to try this variant.\\n\\nGood idea.  Why not?\\n\\ngood idea I\\'ll do it to play solitaire.\\n\\nI\\'ve had the game for two days, and exactly, the choice of starting cards really surprised me.\\nAll the more so because the original solo mode is hard to beat.\\nIn principle, in all other games (of this type), the player has a choice of at least two sets of \"starting\" cards.\\nSo I\\'ll probably use this rule in the setup here too.\\nAnd of course, after the first solo game vs. the \"boxed\" Bot, I then tried a game against the Gingkogawa Clan.\\nAnd I probably won\\'t go back to the original solo mode.I highly recommend it.\\n\\nI do recommend the original (as well as the Ginkogawa clan variant). It\\'s more random, but also simpler to manage (it does always the same). That\\'s good to get to know the game at first, instead of trying to memorise how to manage the Ginko opponent. I\\'ve noticed in my mere 8 plays that there are quite a lot of interesting combinations up for discovery. I think it\\'s perfectly achievable to beat the original bot at every difficulty level. It\\'s just too punishing for the newest players, who are in the pushing buttons stage and make small mistakes, etc. My variant tries to bring back focus on the game that you\\'re playing, and not the game that the bot is playing.\\nI do like the Ginko bot for it has a little decision space, where it chooses to occupy better rooms sometimes. It can still be unlucky, though, and not get in your way at all, so it\\'s a bit random too.\\n\\n\\n\\nIntro to these “overviews before rules” I do:\\nThe goal is to make reading rules easier, for those who want to spend the time. Sounds weird? I\\'ll try to explain...\\nI love a variety of games but I find there’s an issue with rulebooks. A catch 22 if you will.\\nRulebooks (and rule teaches) must be exact, but that creates a lot of time a feeling of anxiety for people as they start reading and wondering “When will it all tie together for me?”, “when will I say ‘ok, THAT’S the game!’?”. Some rulebooks aren’t read or understood because of that, and it’s a shame as many times the game is simpler than was considered.\\nTo prevent that anxiety you need an overview which tells the story of the game (be it in written or video format). You tell a story differently than the way someone explains exact rules. The problem is that rulebooks cannot contain such an overview as it will make them too long, or feel like you’re reading rules twice – hence the catch. But some people do want to spend a few minutes to get the fuller overview of the game, and then dive into the actual rules.\\nSo this is what I did here - a separate thing that comes \"before reading rules\". I would’ve preferred to do this as a video, but right now it’s a high quality youtube channel venture I wasn’t able to raise on my own (in high enough quality). I hope at some point I will move to video format.\\nAnd again, it’s an overview, so the decision whether or not to be exact in details or stay in high level is only determined if I felt, from my experience, that it contributed to the ease of reading the rules after reading this overview and how much clearer they became.\\nThe White Castle\\nThe goal is to finish with the most points.\\nSome points you get during the game and most via endgame scoring.\\nThe game is about 3 rounds, each consisting of 3 turns only – and to make the most of each turn you will want your action to activate additional bonus actions in a larger combination the more you play.\\nDuring each turn a play will select a dice from one of 3 central dice pools (each one has different color dice) and use it to activate an action.\\nNow I need to explain\\nthe players personal board\\nfor a sec – While the majority of actions exist on the main central board, each player has 3 actions they can activate on their personal board (each one requiring a dice of a different color).\\nWhen you activate one of them you look at the row next to it and activate everything visible in it. However, when the game starts those rows are almost completely covered with figures in the players color – a row of gardeners, a row of warriors and row of courtiers – and the more you send those figures to the main board, the stronger those “personal actions” will be.\\nThose rows end in a card you have. The initial card provides some basic action, but players will be able to replace that card with a better one (or different one).\\nOne more important thing on a player’s board is a “Lantern” symbol, next to it is a row of upside-down cards that show “symbols” of bonuses and actions. If, during the game, you get a “Lantern bonus” you get all those symbols. And you can upgrade that bonus by getting more cards because every time you replace the card I mentioned earlier, the former one will be added, upside down, to the lantern bonus row.\\nLet’s go back to\\nthe central dice pools\\n. At the beginning of a round you create three piles of dice in 3 different colors (in each color you use “player count+1” dice), roll them and put each pool in a sequential row, lowest to highest.\\nPlayers can select a die from each pool – either the current highest or the current lowest.\\nAs we’ll see, a higher number helps you activate actions without paying. A low number creates a higher chance that you will need to pay for the action, but if you choose to take the lowest number from a pool, you’ll also get the Lantern bonus I mentioned.\\nHow do you place dice to activate actions?\\nThe central board has randomized parts when the game starts. Several areas in it contain tiles that say what color dice are allowed in each location, and those locations also have a card saying what is the action that location provides.\\nThe main thing though is that each action location also has a number (even the ones on the personal board). When placing a dice in that location you’ll have to pay the difference if you place a lower number die, and gain the difference in money if you place a higher number dice. In 3-4 players you can place a second die in a location and then the number you check if the previous die’s number – so placing a low number makes it easier for the next players.\\nWhat are the possible actions in the different locations?\\nMost of the locations are around getting resources, or activating other actions you would normally need to select in a different location. In some cases you’ll get actions if you pay more, in addition to the money you might need to pay because of a low die.\\nAnother type of action is advancing in a track that determines the player order for the next round, and also provides points if you advance enough in it.\\nActivating actions that activate a chain of other actions is important because there are only 9 turns in the game.\\nOther than those randomized locations there are “fixed” action locations:\\n-\\tA “Well” location where you can always go there and place on a “1” number (so you’ll never need to pay), and gain money/resources.\\n-\\tThe 3 actions on the your personal boards.\\n-\\tLocation to “\\nput a figure out on the board\\n” (of the 3 types of figures).\\nWhat does each figure do except for upgrading your personal action by clearing up the row?\\nGardeners\\nare placed in gardens (for a fee) that are located next to the dice pools. Some gardens are worth more points. Every garden provides a bonus action – and not only that, at the end of the 1st and 2nd round you’ll get that action again if the adjacent dice pool isn’t empty.\\nCourtiers\\n(for a fee) go to a location called the castle gate, and then you can pay an additional fee to take the new or existing courtiers and advance them “up the castle”. The same randomized action areas I described earlier are actually castle rooms in 3 floors. The higher your courtier is by the end of the game, the more points he will be worth. Not only that, when you stop in a room you get the card in the room (and its being replaced) – that allows you to change/upgrade your personal board’s card, and in turn, the “Lantern bonus”. The first courtiers to the final room will also earn a bonus.\\nWarriors\\ngo (for a fee of resources) to one of 3 locations that provide immediate bonuses but also points at the end of the game – but this time they will only be worth points if you managed to get courtiers past the castle gate.\\nAnd that’s it – 9 turns (separated to 3 rounds) of maximizing them for advancements.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m desperate to improve my WC (and now +matcha) strategy. Does anyone know if there are any videos of high scoring games, particularly anything over 80 points?\\n\\nNone I know of.\\nJust keep playing. Your scores will slowly improve, though really high scores depend partly on the luck of the draw.\\n\\nI\\'m desperate to improve my WC (and now +matcha) strategy.

Yes, your answer.\\n\\n\\n\\nReview originally posted on\\nThe Fandomentals\\non 10/10/23\\nThe White Castle is the second game in a trilogy of historical titles by Devir Games, with The Red Cathedral being the first game. The game is for 1-4 players and can be played in an hour. The game is recommended for players 12 and older. The game is designed by Israel Cendrero and Sheila Santos. The game has a theme that focuses on Japan’s famous Himeji Castle, a landmark of Japanese architecture built in the 14th century and made famous by films like Ran and You Only Live Twice. Devir has been making great euro games lately and I have been more and more interested in what they keep on doing.\\nWhat’s In The Box?\\nThe White Castle box\\n77 cards\\n82 tiles\\n5 boards\\n85 wooden pieces\\n15 dice\\n1 rulebook\\nThe components are high quality with wooden meeples used, dice of 3 different colors, and cardboard tokens. The game comes with 3 cardboard bridges that you will construct when first opening the game. Blocks are used to keep track of resources on player boards, and cards are used to change actions throughout the game.\\nHow’s It Play?\\nPlayers will be taking turns choosing one of the dice on one of the three bridges to take actions with. The game consists of 3 rounds where players will take 3 turns in each round, so 9 turns total. When choosing a die to perform your action with, you can choose the higher value die of a certain color, or the lower valued die of a certain color. The color will determine what actions you can perform on the board, and how much money you will gain or possibly pay. So an orange die will activate orange actions and the difference between the selected die value and either the value shown on that spot printed on the board, or the die that has been placed already on that action spot.\\nWhen taking the lower valued die, you will pay the difference of values when placing it on a higher number spot to take its listed action. But unlike when taking the high value die, when you take the low number die you can activate your later reward which can get stronger and better as time in the game goes by.\\nActions can give you resources like coins, daimyo seals, clan points, or one of the 3 resources that you track on your player board. Some actions require you to pay resources to take an action.\\nDice can be placed to take actions in the castle, outside of the walls, the well, or the player’s personal domain. In the castle there are 5 different rooms you can visit, placing a die in those locations. Each location is a little different but might have one or even maybe two actions listed that match the same color of die that you use. This means, sometimes you can use a certain color die to take 2 actions instead of just one.\\nActions done by placing a die outside the walls will let you take the action shown on either the left or the right, and this action is not restricted by color. The well can always be visited no matter what, and will let you gain resources, this way you can always do something on your turn.\\nThe actions on your player board can be activated when placing a die, and you will take the shown resources. As you placed out certain type of clan members, you will be able to gain additional resources as those spots get uncovered.\\nPlayers are trying to get each type of clan member to a good place to score points by the end of the game. Usually when placing out clan members you might need to pay resources but you also might combo additional actions. Gardeners are placed out and you take the action where you decide to place it, and this action will possibly get reactivated at the end of the round.\\nCourtiers are trying to climb the social ranks inside the castle. The higher they get, the better actions and points will be scored. Courtiers will also change cards placed on castle sections and cause new actions to replace old ones.\\nPlayers will continue taking turns until all 3 actions have been performed. The round ends, and new turn order is determined by the distance players are on the passage of time track. Gardeners get reactivated, and die are rerolled for the next round. After 9 totals turns, the game ends and players score points. Coins and daimyo tokens turn into some points, points are awarded for how far you made it on the passage of time track. Lastly, each clan member is scored. The player with the most points, wins the game.\\nThe Verdict\\nI like the choices in the game. First, your choosing one of the available dice, and choosing the lower valued dice will also let you activate your lantern reward, and then the higher valued die will let you earn more money when performing that action, so there is definitely pros and cons either way.\\nYou then have a choice of several actions, some which depending on the color of die you choose can activate two actions. But other actions might help get you what you need to better position your clan members in better positions on the board. The game opens up with better actions as the game goes on, and possible combo actions where you can do something that will cause your clan member to move up and activate another action that activates another clan member.\\nThe game is just nine turns, but when you place all the combo actions into the game, you can see how you can do so much more, especially in later turns. This is like a dream come true for those who don’t enjoy euro games because they are too long. You get the nice crunchy decisions, but in a faster game.\\nEach turn supplies you with either setting up for future turns, or with good decisions between so many available. But you will want to ultimately not ignore pushing your courtiers up in the castle spaces, as that’s a big way to gain points at the end of the game. In fact, your warriors don’t even score if you don’t have any courtiers inside the castle. And gardeners give you even more actions that trigger again at the end of the round.\\nOf course depending on how many players you have in the game that determines how many dice are rolled, sometimes a bad roll will leave payers will some less interesting decisions. In just 9 turns, you need to start producing some big actions at the very beginning of the game, don’t just wait until you have enough resources and then decide to trigger those big combo actions, start with it at the beginning of the game.\\nThe game can get confusing as you are matching colors in different ways, and players can get confused thinking they are taking a certain action just to realize they have been scanning the board wrong and looking at actions they can’t even take that turn. After playing the game, you tend to figure out how colors match up, so this really is only a problem for newer players.\\nOverall, this is a very solid fast playing eurogame. You only have 9 total turns, so you will need to get going from the beginning of the game. The game provides lots of choices, and chance for combo moves to do multiple things in one turn. This is the second game in this trilogy and can’t wait to see what the 3rd game does.\\n\\nAdd the new\\n\\nexpansion!\\n\\nAdd the new\\n\\nexpansion!\\n\\nhelps?\\n\\nAdd the new\\n\\nexpansion!\\n\\nhelps?\\n\\nGives you another turn and three more dice to place, but still a very tight game,\\nIt’s not really a trilogy;\\n\\nis quite different.\\n\\nAdd the new\\n\\nexpansion!\\n\\nhelps?\\n\\nGives you another turn and three more dice to place, but still a very tight game,\\nIt’s not really a trilogy;\\n\\nis quite different.\\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure that Shei and Isra have come right out and said that they are working on a 3rd small box, deep strategy game with the historical \"color\" \"building\" motif.

(Counters are usually flat, like the passage of time token. No component list in the rules is BAD. Not everyone carries a phone everywhere, 24/7.)\\n\\nYou\\'re going to be ok... take a deep breath.\\n\\nSmart, are we? Why not answer my question, yes or no.\\n\\nHi.

But it\\'s a fun game, in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis solo variant uses the official rules for the Solitaire Mode, with the following change:\\nThe Rival (automa) acts as the first player in each round even if his heron counter is in 2nd position\\n(follow all official rules for the coins bonus at the end of the round).\\nFurthermore, after his actions, do not put the drawn cards on the bottom of the Solitaire deck, so the player can easily see which dice can no longer be taken by the rival, to avoid having to memorize them\\n(shuffle the entire deck each round, as usual).\\nGames so far: 8 at Easy difficult level.\\nWins: Automa 4 - Player 4.\\nFinal score difference: -10, -10, -11, -3, +10, +1, +19 , +19,\\nScore range: Automa min 42, max 56 - Player min 36, max 75.\\n[YASV = Yet Another Solo Variant]\\n\\nHmm, so maybe I am missing something, but you gave no advantage to player (because the cards can be memorized anyway), but you explicitly made herons and therefore lantern useless and made bot always first, so basically compared to official solo, this is just harder and makes the strategic choice regarding lantern for the player? What am I missing?\\n\\nHmm, so maybe I am missing something, but you gave no advantage to player (because the cards can be memorized anyway), but you explicitly made herons and therefore lantern useless and made bot always first, so basically compared to official solo, this is just harder and makes the strategic choice regarding lantern for the player?

I was thinking the same as you in terms of the multiplier.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the reason?\\n\\nIf it was allowed, climbing would be the best option when there are no warriors left on the board.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the reason?\\n\\nThe \"good reason\" Adam alluded to, if I understood him correctly, refers to the\\nrulebook\\nnot mentioning any sort of social climbing for warriors. There\\'s no mention because there\\'s no such mechanism in the game.\\nSocial climbing\\nis embedded in the role of a courtesan though. It\\'s their core mechanism: they need to request an audience with the Daimyo (1vp), ascend to a steward role (3vp), then a diplomat (6vp) and finally a courtesan in the Daimyo\\'s own retinue of advisors (10vp).\\nThere\\'s no\\nmilitary advancement\\nor\\nclimbing through the ranks\\nfor warriors in the game. Warriors have their own specific quirk here, scoring over the reputation your clan has accrued according to how close to the Daimyo they live.\\nThis is key, as back in the day I believe those that live closer to the Himeji Castle (the White Castle) or higher in it were considered of better social status. Such was the dynamic in many castle towns in Japan.\\nIn a more pragmatic sense though, there\\'s no\\nsocial climbing\\nmilitary advancement for warriors because the game didn\\'t conceive such a mechanism, and throwing this one on top of what we\\'ve got will most probably, heck, most\\ndefinitely\\nskew the game balance and the intended experience. Same with adding an extra round to make the game looser as some would do to the base game.\\nYou\\'re obviously free to try it out though! If it turns out to be fun for you and your group, does it really matter?\\nAs Adam said though, there\\'s a good reason you didn\\'t find anything of the sort in the rulebook. There\\'s no such mechanism.\\n\\nThank you for detailed answer!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Tokugawa can not place his die and must perform the action of the well, he only takes the money and performs no action after, much like the human player.

Feel free to suggest improvements, I might upload more pics later.\\nGeneral Thoughts\\nMeeple actions (gardener action, courtier action, warrior action)  are the only way to place meeples on the board in TWC, and meeples are the main source of victory points (VP) in the game. Since the game has only 9 turns but 15 available meeples, you need to take as many actions as possible, ideally chaining two or even more in one turn.\\nWhere to find meeple actions?\\n-Each card in the lower and middle floor castle has an action slot with a dark background. On the first floor these cost an additional seal and three dice pips, on the second floor four dice pips only. The first floor action can have the same dice color as one resource slot with a white background. These are of course especially attractive and should be picked first.\\n-Outside of the castle, there are two slots that allow either a courtier action or one of the other two actions for five pips. These should only be used if there is no other way to get the desired meeple action since the other spots are more efficient.\\n-Gardens on the right side can have a meeple action for three coins. They can also activate dice in the castle or on the player board which can activate meeple actions.\\n-The blue tiles on training grounds can have meeple actions or activate dice actions of a certain color in the castle or any action on a player board.\\n-The card on the right side of the player board always has one meeple action.\\nActions vs resources\\nMost meeple actions also provide resources. A pure resource move in the castle or the well action should only be done as last resort (when no affordable actions are available) or as preparation for an expensive chain move.\\nPriorities: Engine building\\nAll actions provide points and most of them provide resources, but some actions should be done earlier since they fire the few engines in the game that have an impact on resource generation: Gardeners get activated again after round 1 and round 2, courtiers improve your lantern bonus and placing any meeple will improve your player board action.\\nChaining actions\\nRight side gardener actions and blue tiles on warrior actions can provide one more action, courtiers cannot. Chain actions require some planning, you need all the resources lined up. Its possible to chain 3 or even 4 actions if you have enough resources. There is an important update to the rules: you can only use each player board action once per turn. Otherwise there would be a constellation where you could place all samurai in one turn by activating the middle row on the player board over and over.\\nAnalysis of the three actions\\nGardener actions (Bridge symbol)\\n\\nGardener actions have two types. There are five cards of each type and three of these will be laid out in a game.\\nThe left side cards cost 1-3 rice, provide 1-5 VP and some resources. Its a good idea to place as many as possible of the left side gardeners during the first round, since you will receive the resources again after round 1 and 2 if there are dice left on the bridge. The sigil garden is probably the worst return on investment but still ok. The others are great.\\nThe right side cards cost 3-5 rice to place and 3-4 coins to activate and provide another action or a free dice on the player board or in the castle. These also earn more VP (up to 9). These are valuable in the midgame for chaining purposes. If you can place on one of these during the second round and keep enough resources to activate it again between the rounds, they provide a lot of victory points. Activating them during the first round might prove pretty difficult due to lack of resources.\\nPlacing several gardeners also frees the iron row of your player board for big endgame moves.\\nCourtier actions (castle symbol)\\nCourtiers cost two coins to place at the castle gates (1 VP) and either two pearl for a single promotion or five pearl for a double promotion. On the first floor, they provide 3 VP, usually two resources and a new card for the player board which later turns into a coin as lantern bonus. On the second floor they provide 6 VP, usually three resources and a card that turns into a VP bonus. At the top, they provide 10VP, a lantern action and one of three resource rewards.\\nIn my opinion, its best to use the 2 pearl part of the action as often as possible to get many courtiers on the first floor. That way, you get most points out of your warriors and get a strong lantern bonus with many coins. If you have excess pearl, double promotions are a good way to convert these into VP.\\nWhen picking a card, useful resources are good, but towards the late game getting a dark placement action on the middle row of your player board can prepare a powerful chain move.\\nWarrior actions (training ground symbol)\\nTraining grounds have yellow and/or blue tiles. The yellow tiles provide resources, while the blue tiles provide actions or dice symbols. The first training ground costs 1 iron, has a yellow tile and provides 1 VP per courtier in the castle. The second costs three iron, has a blue tile and also 1 VP per courtier. The third costs 5 iron, has both tiles and adds 2 VP per courtier in the castle.\\nIn general, I think saving up for the 5 iron training ground is best. That way you get most VP per action. Of course, this also depends on the tiles on the training grounds. There is also no reason to get warriors early so you can do these actions late in the game or when there is a good opportunity for a chain. You can get the required iron from iron bonus starting cards and the middle row on your player board once you played some gardeners.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith this tile,\\ncan I activate one of my personal domain where dice was previously placed ?\\nor can I activate my personal domain first and place a dice on exactly same line next turn?\\n\\nHey! The official ruling is that you cannot trigger the same personal domain line twice via\\nthat icon\\n, but it is irrelevant whether there\\'s a dice in that given line.\\nThat icon is comprised of the personal domain icon (the three banners) and the multicolored dice, denoting you can trigger any one of the three lines in your personal domain.\\nWhen you place a dice directly on your personal domain board, you\\'ll see that the icon (p. 8 of the rulebook) is only the three banners.\\nWhenever you trigger that icon in your post (banners + multicolored dice), you can activate any line of your personal domain even if there\\'s a dice in there that you\\'ve placed via the personal domain action per se. But you cannot loop that line in a single dice placement (single turn): if you would somehow trigger that icon a second time within the same turn, you must choose a different line.\\nSorry for the roundabouty post\\n\\n\\n\\nWe had a strange thing happening tonight. I had the first card after setup with a Samurai action. I managed to get to 5 iron in the first turn with a Gardener action, then in the second of my turns I played the Garden action in my board that got me 2 iron and a Samurai action. So, one Samurai on space 5, 2 iron left and the 2 tokens in the 5 space allowed me to get, via the white space action, 3 iron (back to 5) and another Samurai action in my board. This in loop until I could play all 5 Samurai in 1 turn. And resources left to spare. I then kept playing Courtier actions for the rest of the game, to score > 70 points just in the Palace.\\nIt’s a combination once in a lifetime, valid or not? I was surprised, I planned the move to, my basic calculation, do this twice, but then I found myself in the loop.\\nWhat do you think? See the image for reference.\\n\\nThis has been errata\\'d (specifically the icon granting the player board action):\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3183249/article/43225624#43...\\n\\n\\n\\nUnsere spannende Reise, die in den majestätischen Kuppeln der roten Kathedrale begann, geht weiter und führt uns bis hin zur eindrucksvollen weißen Burg in Japan. Doch Vorsicht! Dies ist keine gewöhnliche Sightseeing-Tour – ihr seid verantwortlich für eure Gärtner, Krieger und Höflinge und versucht den Daimyo mit euren Leistungen zu beeindrucken.\\nDas vollständige Review inklusive Fotos und detaillierter Regelerklärungen zu Spielaufbau und Spielablauf findest Du auf\\nSofahelden.de\\nHier ist unser Fazit:\\nSpielspaß\\n: Uns hat das Spiel sehr gut gefallen und richtig Spaß gemacht. Warum? Die Bonusaktionen! Irgendwie hat es sich angefühlt wie ein roll-and-write, in dem man nicht aufhören kann Dinge durchzukreuzen, weil eines zum anderen führt. Die weiße Burg ist sehr belohnend, wenn’s gut läuft. Aber umso schmerzhafter ist es, wenn es nicht so gut läuft und ein Zug relativ mau ausfällt. Es sind eben nur neun Spielerzüge. Und das muss man dann natürlich auch abkönnen.\\nBalancing/Glücksfaktor\\n: Es ist ein Strategiespiel mit Würfel. Also ja, Glück spielt definitiv eine Rolle. Würfel der entsprechenden Farbe und Augenzahl müssen zur richtigen Zeit verfügbar sein und die Würfelfelder sollten nicht durch Mitspieler blockiert sein, wenn man sie braucht. Augenzahlen kann man allerdings gut kompensieren, wenn man seinen Münzvorrat im Griff hat. Dann zahlt man eben etwas drauf, um die Aktion nutzen zu können. Insgesamt bleibt es aber ein Strategiespiel. So lässt sich eben auch die Spielerreihenfolge manipulieren, um dann eben in der neuen Runde als Startspieler volle Entscheidungsfreiheit zu haben.\\nKomplexität/Regeln\\n: Dank der sehr zugänglichen Regeln wirkt Die weiße Burg fast simpel für ein Kennerspiel. Das ist super, denn die Regeln sind schnell erklärt und der Spielfluss stellt sich sehr schnell ein. Auf der anderen Seite handelt es sich um ein sehr strategisches Spiel, bei dem es darauf ankommt, die gegebenen Würfel mit seinen begrenzten Zügen optimal und clever einzusetzen. Alle Möglichkeiten durchzurechnen, um zu schauen, welcher Weg zu der maximalen Anzahl an Bonusaktionen führt, die einem auch noch am meisten Siegpunkte bringen, kann allerdings dauern. Analyse-Paralyse Gefahr. Und es geht schon direkt vor der ersten Aktion los: Nehme ich den Würfel mit der niedrigen Augenzahl und kassiere zusätzlich den Laternen-Bonus, oder nehme ich vielleicht doch lieber den mit der höheren Augenzahl, um Münzen zu sparen? Aber das sollte auf keinen Fall abschrecken! Die Regel ohne Solomodus hat übrigens 15 Seiten, ist aber auch im DIN A5 Format gehalten. Großes Lob für die Symbol-Übersicht auf der Rückseite!\\nSpielerinteraktion/Spieleranzahl\\n: Die weiße Burg hat wenig Interaktion und ist eher solistisch. Klar, man kann sich Würfel gegenseitig wegnehmen oder Würfelfelder blockieren, aber darüber hinaus gibt es keine direkte Interaktion. Aus diesem Grund ist die weiße Burg auch ein sehr gutes Spiel zu zweit und gewinnt wenig bis gar nichts mit mehreren Spielern.\\nSpieldauer\\n: Auf der Verpackung steht 50 bis 80 Minuten. Zu zweit lagen wir sogar in unserer Erstpartie knapp drunter. Ein Vorteil ist auch, dass sich das Spiel gut in ca. 10-15 Minuten erklären lässt. Wie oben bereits erwähnt kann die Spieldauer aber auch explodieren, sollten Mitspieler zu Analyse-Paralyse tendieren. Wir können uns vorstellen, dass dann die down time auch durchaus störend sein kann, weil beim Denken ja bekanntlich erstmal nichts passiert (‚gähn‘). Einmal losgelegt, ist die Aktionskombo selbst aber dann sehr schnell ausgeführt. Alles in allem also ein für ein Strategiespiel eher schnelles Spiel, die richtige Gruppe vorausgesetzt.\\nWiederspielbarkeit\\n: Sämtliche Aktionsmöglichkeiten auf dem Spielplan werden zu Spielbeginn zufällig ausgelegt. Darüber hinaus zusätzlich auch die Würfelfarben, mit denen die Aktionen ausgelöst werden können. Dadurch ist keine Partie wie die andere. Und es müssen nicht mal neue Regeln gelernt werden, wie häufig in Spielen, die mit Erweiterungen oder Modulen Abwechslung erreichen wollen. Module gibt es hier keine. Die Abwechslung ist automatisch in den Spielaufbau integriert. Hinzu kommt, dass sich die weiße Burg relativ schnell erklären und spielen lässt, immer ein Pluspunkt beim Thema Wiederspielbarkeit.\\nHat\\'s euch gefallen? Wir freuen uns auf ein\\nDaumen hoch!\\nAnderer Meinung oder sonst etwas auf dem Herzen? Wir diskutieren gerne mit euch in den\\nKommentaren!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich would you recommend between White Castle and Sand.\\nNot afraid of crunchiness at all. Just want a good and fair strategy puzzle game to pass the time.\\nPlease and thank you.\\n\\nI think it really comes down to which mechanisms do you prefer. I play both Sand and White Castle solo and multiplayer.\\nIn both cases, the bot is easy to run. Sand solo offers a closer experience to multiplayer than WC. When I play WC solo, I use the unofficial solo variant than you can find in the files section, the Ginkogawa clan as I find it works better.\\nSo if you like pickup and deliver, Sand is a great solo for that. Although the rule book is terrible, it\\'s easy to get past it, and worth it as well. Sand plays longer that WC.\\nWC is shorter and delivers more satisfying combos and the dice elements of the game are better than Sand.\\nMy conclusion, it\\'s a tie. Tie breaker: amount of time available.\\n\\nThe White Castle, no doubt about it.\\n\\nHmm Camilo can you expand on that?\\nSeems like ScragleRed is loving both of them.\\nYeah, time can be a constraint but it\\'s not the main obstacle for me since I can manage...\\n\\nTWC is tougher to win solo but it’s the better game, which is backed by its 8.0 BGG average rating vs. Sand’s 6.9.\\n\\nTWC is tougher to win solo but it’s the better game, which is backed by its 8.0 BGG average rating vs. Sand’s 6.9.\\n\\nI agree with you there, in the sense that if you take the BGG score into account, it shows that the multiplayer game is the better one... and it is. WC is superior to Sand, when playing multiplayer and for many good reasons, one of them also being personal preference.\\nBut as far as soloing either games, they deliver two very different and distinct experiences but I feel they are equivalent in terms of decision space.\\n\\nTWC is tougher to win solo but it’s the better game, which is backed by its 8.0 BGG average rating vs. Sand’s 6.9.\\n\\nTo be fair, I think Sand\\'s rating suffer a lot from its crappy rulebook. A lot of the reviews were really unsatisfied with it.\\nHence my dilemna.\\nI saw a lot of reviews say to avoid White Castle for solo since the bot can be so swingy.\\nSo confusing and there\\'s no consensus.\\n\\nTWC is tougher to win solo but it’s the better game, which is backed by its 8.0 BGG average rating vs. Sand’s 6.9.\\n\\nTo be fair, I think Sand\\'s rating suffer a lot from its crappy rulebook.

Because I have never played sand.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnalysis of starting cards\\nI havent found a strategy guide for White Castle yet, so I decided to write one on my own. Here comes the first part, an analysis of the starting cards:\\n\\nGeneral thoughts\\nLantern bonuses:\\npearl > iron > rice\\nYou need a lot of\\npearls\\nto get all your courtiers into the castle, and if you get more, you can promote them for VP and an even better lantern bonus.\\nSince the 5\\niron\\ntraining ground has twice the points, having a lot of iron is good. Its also ok to get your samurai onto the board late in the game, so accumulating iron over time is a good idea.\\nWith\\nrice\\n, you want to place your gardeners early so a flat amount of rice is better than rice over time. Later in the game the rice gets less interesting and once you placed all 5 gardeners its just 1-2 victory points.\\nResources\\nrice > pearl > iron > seals > coins\\nYou want\\nrice\\nearly to place as many gardeners as possible before the first round ends so you get the garden bonuses twice (unless your opponents clear a bridge).\\nPearls\\nallow you to place courtiers which are mandatory for points and improve your lantern bonus, so its better to place them early.\\nIron\\nis needed for samurai which you can place in the last rounds, but sometimes you want to play a samurai for chaining purposes so having some iron is always good.\\nSeals\\nare needed for some meeple placement spaces and can be changed into coins at any time so they are plain better. Having some\\ncoins\\nis good so you are more flexible with dice placements and can activate the better gardeners which cost 3-4 coins.\\nCard analysis\\nCard 1:\\nRice bonus, 2 rice, 2 iron, 1 pearl, 4 coins and a seal. This allows for a Gardener right away and adds a good base for another meeple placement. A very attractive card to get your engine going.\\nCard 2:\\nRice bonus, 4 rice, 2 iron, 3 coins and 2 seals. With this, you can chain a gardener with a samurai or another gardener in the first round. A most attractive card in my opinion.\\nCard 3:\\nRice bonus, victory point bonus, one wild resource, 2 coins and 2 seals. A bad card for a bad start. Only few resources and victory points from lantern bonus won’t help you to get an engine started either.\\nCard 4:\\nPearl bonus, 2 wild resources, 4 coins, 2 seals. A decent card, especially with a constant flow of pearls from lantern bonuses later to get your courtiers running. The rice cards offer more starting resources.\\nCard 5:\\nPearl bonus, coin bonus, 2 rice, 1 iron, 2 coins, 1 seal. A good card. This card makes it very attractive to go for lantern bonus early for a steady flow of pearls and coins. 2 rice help for an early gardener.\\nCard 6:\\nPearl bonus, 2 iron, 1 pearl, 5 coins, 1 seal. A bad card. No early gardener or courtier. No use for the many coins.\\nCard 7:\\nIron bonus, seal bonus, 2 pearl, 1 iron, 4 coins. An interesting card. The seal bonus is the strongest bonus card, 2 pearls allow for an early courtier so you might get an early lantern bonus. But no rice! Maybe good if you can get rice from a samurai or courtier placement.\\nCard 8:\\nIron bonus, 3 wild resources, 4 coins, 1 seal. A decent card. The wild resources allow for a tailored start (depending on available gardeners), iron bonus is better than rice, but other cards offer more starting resources.\\nCard 9:\\nIron bonus, 1 rice, 2 iron, 1 pearl, 3 coins, 1 seal. A mediocre card. No early courtier, only one rice, just plain worse than card 1 or 2 resource wise.\\nThe second starting card\\nThe second starting card is less important since you dont always use it before doing a courtier action, but in some starting positions it is helpful to have another way to do a gardener action early since the gardener actions on the board can be very contested.\\n\\nAnalysis of starting cards\\nI havent found a strategy guide for White Castle yet, so I decided to write one on my own.

This allows for a Gardener right away and adds a good base for another meeple placement. A very attractive card to get your engine going.\\nCard 2:\\nRice bonus, 4 rice, 2 iron, 3 coins and 2 seals. With this, you can chain a gardener with a samurai or another gardener in the first round. A most attractive card in my opinion.\\nCard 3:\\nRice bonus, victory point bonus, one wild resource, 2 coins and 2 seals. A bad card for a bad start. Only few resources and victory points from lantern bonus won’t help you to get an engine started either.\\nCard 4:\\nPearl bonus, 2 wild resources, 4 coins, 2 seals. A decent card, especially with a constant flow of pearls from lantern bonuses later to get your courtiers running. The rice cards offer more starting resources.\\nCard 5:\\nPearl bonus, coin bonus, 2 rice, 1 iron, 2 coins, 1 seal. A good card. This card makes it very attractive to go for lantern bonus early for a steady flow of pearls and coins. 2 rice help for an early gardener.\\nCard 6:\\nPearl bonus, 2 iron, 1 pearl, 5 coins, 1 seal. A bad card. No early gardener or courtier. No use for the many coins.\\nCard 7:\\nIron bonus, seal bonus, 2 pearl, 1 iron, 4 coins. An interesting card. The seal bonus is the strongest bonus card, 2 pearls allow for an early courtier so you might get an early lantern bonus. But no rice! Maybe good if you can get rice from a samurai or courtier placement.\\nCard 8:\\nIron bonus, 3 wild resources, 4 coins, 1 seal. A decent card. The wild resources allow for a tailored start (depending on available gardeners), iron bonus is better than rice, but other cards offer more starting resources.\\nCard 9:\\nIron bonus, 1 rice, 2 iron, 1 pearl, 3 coins, 1 seal. A mediocre card. No early courtier, only one rice, just plain worse than card 1 or 2 resource wise.\\n\\nFirst of all, great analysis of the starting cards.\\nSecond, may I start an argument on one of the card. Card 6 is not that bad. I can understand why you thought this is a bad card. But, I think the best way to utilized this card was using it at the first turn where you took lowest die (to activate lantern bonus to gain additional pearl) and then go 1st or 2nd floor and activate Courtier action. The 5 coins is a way to pay the difference so that you could at least guaranteed to be able to take Courtier action that turn and you could either take another Courtier action to build up the garden or immediately go to garden so that at least in 1st round you could activate 1 gardener.\\nDespite that, I still think it\\'s not a great card since, based on your thoughts, you prioritized to use gardener first. But, I don\\'t think it\\'s totally bad given the potential this card has.\\n\\nAnalysis of starting cards\\nI havent found a strategy guide for White Castle yet, so I decided to write one on my own.

I didn\\'t check the dice before picking starting card. Instead, I\\'m checking rewards and actions available in the castle area first then decide the starting card.\\n\\nOf course the board state and dice on the bridge are important for picking starting cards, too. Comparably high left dice make lantern strategies better, its important if and which actions are available in combination with resources... but that would be too much for this card analysis.\\n\\nNice write up!\\nI will point out that card number 3 the one that gives you an extra vp into your lantern can have a whole strategy built around it, and you can end up getting 15 or so extra points thanks to it. Will you need to \"waste\" an early round turn to get some resources to catch up to other\\'s starting resources, yeah probably but you can probably make up for it in other ways.\\nYou didn\\'t mention the paired starting card, what action is on that seems to matter in how it combines with your starting resources and you starting lantern bonus.

I prefer coins since getting an early resource engine seems more important to me than early points.\\nAs far as the 2nd starting card is concerned, of course a gardener action is more attractive early on, but as soon as you play your first courtier action it is gone anyway and the player board actions are more attractive later in the game since they offer more resources. If you use them early you will gain a resource but lose two coins. I will edit this in the main post, thanks for the heads up!\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore I discovered the white castle, my favourite game was Arnak. It has a rather similar feel to me.\\n-the limited number of turns makes action optimisation and efficiency very important.\\n-Its a mid-weight Euro for up to 4 players, but 2-3 players works best.\\n-resource management is important.\\n-you build a little engine but cant use it fully.\\n-Especially for new players its hard to hit all the goals.\\n-room/garden/field cards are a bit like site tiles in Arnak: each game is a little bit different.\\n-there is little player interaction, just some blocking of spaces.\\n-The production value is very good.\\nDo you have similar feelings or do some people here love one game and loathe the other? Are there other games with the same feel, maybe Castles of Burgundy?\\n\\nTo me, CoB does not have the same feel as TWC.  Keen to hear opinions on Arnak though.\\n\\nis my favourite game. So I am keen to hear suggestions although perhaps it would be better on the Arnak page.\\n\\nis nothing like Arnak for me. The things I like about Arnak are the tech track and the slow deckbuilding and TWC has neither. I find\\n\\nas the same tech track feel but the cards work in a different way. You progress up the tech track based on the tags on your cards.\\n\\ncomes pretty close but you can get extra workers and just a maximum of 6 cards. The tech track, which is the branches of the tree, only has a few steps but like Arnak its race to lock in points.\\nWhat I like about\\n\\nis the dice drafting. In most other games, like\\n\\nyou have your own dice. Whereas with TWC the dice are shared. So I would say\\n\\n, which is also about resource management. This has recently been reimplemented as\\n\\n. Also\\n\\n.\\n\\nI echo the op that this has a similar feeling with lost ruins of arnak I might even group these two games together.\\nIt’s just how I look at it. if you ask me the thing I like most about arnak is the bit where you keep grinding to get more work done (points). Each round there are only two workers, but yet one can easily come up with 5/6 actions which is the same vibe in white castle. So because their catch to me is the same I would group them together (oh yes they both worker placement game too).\\nI can’t think of another game like this though. It is this uniqueness that made us love lost ruins of arnak.\\nEdit: actually would games like Aquatica give same feel? You also sit there kept thinking what you could generate to make the combo work. Don’t think castle of burgundy is anything like it though.\\n\\nBefore I discovered the white castle, my favourite game was Arnak.

Are there other games with the same feel, maybe Castles of Burgundy?\\n\\nAll three games are in my top ten precisely because they are quite different. Due to the dice manipulation, TWC is more like CoB.\\nArnak has the deck building aspect that makes it distinct.\\n\\nGiven that White Castle is an extreme case study in efficiency optimization, I cannot say it feels like much else in my fairly large collection.\\nI own both Arnak, and Castles, and while superficial similarities can easily be found, the *feel* is fairly unique. For one, White Castle often teases you with an engine you rare can run, given those optimizational efficiencies, and limited actions. Another game with exactly the same mechanisms, but a wildly more open action/option space wouldn\\'t strike me as similar.\\n\\nWell, the fact that they are all in your top ten might be because you like tight mid-weight Euro optimisation puzzles. And these three are among the best midweight Euros. Of course, if they were too similar youd need only one of them.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe White Castle\\nQuick Overview:\\nIn the White Castle, players incarnate a Feudal Japanese clan vying for the favor of the great Daimyo. The main mechanics are Dice Drafting and Placement coupled with Resource Management and a bit of Tableau-Building.\\n5 things I like\\n-I love the pacing of this game, a brisk and tense 3 rounds of 3 actions, but it still feels like you can get lots done with good planning and chaining of actions.\\n-The highly variable setup and random dice rolls mean no two games will be the same, I\\'m closing in on 30 plays, and every setup feels like a fresh puzzle and experience!\\n-The production is quite good especially for that price point, nice meeples and dice with a good looking mainboard and the little cardboard bridges all add to the experience.\\n-Easy to learn, hard to master! This is a very streamlined design, but by no means are the decisions easy or trivial, the iconography is also very clean and simple to digest. I managed to get my non-gamer folks in their mid 60s to pick this up and play in about 10 minutes, and they had a good time with it too!\\n-I love the bridge mechanics, taking a lower dice to get a benefit versus the high dice for money, which color of dice is also very important since those can stop the gardens from triggering and the placement spots in the castle or on your board are very limited and color-dependent as well.\\n3 Things I don\\'t like\\n-The theme while interesting is definitely mostly pasted on, it\\'s a mechanical Euro and I love those, but I do generally enjoy some thematic implementation in my games too.\\n-I\\'m still not sure how I feel about the gardeners, they really incentivize you to deploy them often and early since they trigger only after the 1st and 2nd round, but then again, those can be countered with smart drafting, and you could aim for upgrading your lantern instead, mostly a pet peeve.\\n-I\\'m happy with boxes not being too big for no reasons, but the White Castle is the other way around, the game barely fits back into the box without careful puzzling and chucking the extra language rulebooks.\\nPictures\\nA recent endgame;\\n\\nSome solo fun;\\n\\nMatching glasses;\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nThe White Castle is for me as close to a perfect mechanical eurogame as you can get. It gives me the satisfaction of a heavier title in a fraction of the time and setup. I wholeheartedly recommend it with the only caveat that you are interested in dicey euros and aren\\'t all about thematic integration. I am also beyond excited for the incoming Matcha expansion!\\n9.5/10\\n\\nNice review.\\nOn the thematic integration, I think it\\'s present. I feel one could argue the relationship between warriors and courtiers (warriors gaining their value through the strength and influence of the courtiers in then castle) speaks to a degree of thematic integrationist depth, though maybe I\\'m reading the tea leaves a bit too closely?\\nThe Gardener-to-rewards and VP exchange doesn\\'t make a lot of sense, but for all I know gardens and gardeners played an outsized role at Himeji Castle. A cursory Google hunt turns up a well known garden outside of the walls called Kokoen Garden, and my instincts tell me this mechanism is rooted in this garden\\'s acclaim.\\n\\nThanks! I\\'m sure research was done and thematic implementation was considered, I just don\\'t \"feel\" it like in some other titles. To be fair, I am not knowledgeable at all about the source subject, and I had a really hard time coming up with 3 downsides as The White Castle is easily one of my favorite games of the last year or so.\\n\\nNice review. I share your thoughts. What I absolutely adore is the limit of 9 actions, it\\'s great and it\\'s a small niche of the hobby.\\n\\nBeen really enjoying your reviews, Alex. Looking forward to more\\n\\nI also think the theme doesn’t really come out for me. To me this game felt like a fairly dry euro, when it doesn’t appear to be.\\n\\nCan’t wait for the expansion,\\n\\n!\\n\\nThematic integration.\\nYou wouldn\\'t like\\n\\nthen.\\nIts golem edition reskin shows it can be easily repainted as anything. Ducks, Brussel sprouts, clouds.\\nCompared to that game, The White Castle is dripping.\\n\\nI am not a huge fan of Century indeed, but mostly for gameplay reasons. I\\'m mostly mechanically driven as a player, so while I don\\'t personally feel the theme, I\\'m sure there is a thematic reason behind most mechanics!\\n\\nGood game with home rules, but the base rule feel that lack of combos when you cannot perform the dark background actions when sending a man into the castle.\\n\\nGood game with home rules, but the base rule feel that lack of combos when you cannot perform the dark background actions when sending a man into the castle.\\n\\nWhat houserules do you do?\\n\\nThanks for the review!

He only take coins because of the dice placement\\n\\nThanks! Enjoying the game very much and also been reading up on the original White Castle which has been fascinating.\\n\\n\\n\\nESPAÑOL\\nHola, dejo una duda aquí a ver si puede resolverme alguien.\\nAl acabar la primera y segunda ronda se activan las acciones de los jardineros que todavía conservan un dado en el puente superior. Esta acción ¿sólo se puede activar si tienes los recursos necesarios para pagarla, si hubiera que hacerlo, o se omite el pago y se activa igualmente? Es que mi lógica me dice que solo se puede activar si la puedes pagar (se activaría como en un turno de juego), pero el uso del futuro perfecto («se activará») en el reglamento me deja la duda, porque en otros muchos reglamentos de otros juegos en estos casos pondría «si se puede».\\nENGLISH\\nHello, I\\'m leaving a question here to see if someone can help me.\\nAt the end of the first and second round, the actions of the gardeners who still have a die on the upper bridge are activated. Can this action only be activated if you have the necessary resources to pay it, if necessary, or is the payment omitted and activated anyway? The thing is that my logic tells me that it can only be activated if you can pay for it (it would be activated as in a game turn), but the use of the future perfect (\"it will be activated\") in the rules leaves me in doubt, because in many others rules of other games in these cases I would say \"if you can.\"\\n\\nYou\\nactivate\\nthe action regardless. You can only\\nuse\\nit if you have the necessary payment.\\nEnglish can be very subtle at times.\\nThink of it as the difference between opening a door, and going through it.\\n\\nLa acción solo se hace efectiva si tienes el dinero para pagarla.\\n\\nThank you Greg.\\n\\nGracias Camilo.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe icon that triggers one of your personal actions (the cube with 3 lines next to it) says you can\\'t trigger the same line twice in a round. If you trigger it off a gardener, I understand that means you can\\'t do the same one again at the end of round garden trigger but what about using a die? Can you place a die there AND trigger via the icon in the same round? If not, does order matter?\\n\\nIs it \"in a round\" or \"in a turn\"? I think you can\\'t trigger the same personal action twice *in a turn*, because that can create infinite combos\\n\\nAs Yaro pointed out, the restriction is on successive activations of the same line of your personal domain in a single\\nturn\\n. You cannot trigger the exact same line of your Personal Domain through that specific Gardener/Yard Tile/whatever again in the same turn, as a consequence of a single dice placement.\\nThis rule is there just to break loops.\\n\\nWhat text are you referring to that specifically says \"you can\\'t trigger the same line twice in a round\"? The appendix does not mention this. There was a separate thread involving a very particular setup that included the promo tile that allowed for someone to deploy all of their warriors in one turn to which the designers admitted that this was an unintended consequence/result. The conclusion of that conversation was that \"as if you had placed a die there\" meant that the no stacking two dice rule applied if you already had a dice there. That is however, a specific house rule or implementation that I don\\'t believe is present in the rulebook as is.\\nTLDR: According to the rule book, you are allowed to trigger the same line that you used that turn or round (even multiple times in rare instances where the warrior action allows for it as well as a gardener action).\\n\\nHere\\n\\n, with link to the relevant comments. So you won\\'t find that text or rule anywhere in the current rulebook, but it should be present in future printings.\\nI\\'m not sure we\\'re on the same page though, given that you\\'re referring to turns and rounds. You absolutely can trigger the same personal domain line throughout one of the 3 game Rounds. As per the designers, you cannot trigger the same line a second time in a single dice placement action, if that second activation would appear somewhere in the chain of effects of a given player turn.\\n\\nThat is however, a specific house rule or implementation that I don\\'t believe is present in the rulebook as is.\\n\\nSince this comes from the designers and will be included in the rulebook in future printings, i would consider this an official erratum.\\n\\nDidn\\'t know they put in the official rulebook! Changes a lot of different combos then!\\n\\n\\n\\nHoping to find this soon.\\n\\nI see it in a lot of stores or BGG or mail order\\n\\nHoping to find this soon.\\n\\nHi, thanks for asking.

Do you mean the two steps of the courtier action (place + move), or do you mean double as in somehow you managed to trigger two instances of the same action (two courtier placement actions)?\\nIf the former, you can only move one courtier (so if you opt to pay for 2 movements, both must be used with the same courtier).\\nIf the latter, you just do the action steps twice (full sequence).\\n\\nI think you choose the order.  So if your first action replaced the card, your second action would be on the new card.\\n\\nOn the first floor (after entrance) where there can be 3 dice icon.

In this case I think both games are really good, but maybe I prefer Iki over TWC, even if playing in two I would prefer TWC. TWC is much shorter then Iki (hopefully the new expansion will make it longer, adding a few actions/dices).\\n\\nWhite Castle is far faster than IKI in my experience. For two player IKI has a special mode which I have not used yet. I prefer it with four players as it makes the interaction with market stalls more interesting to me, but from what I recall the two player mode is likely fine.\\nIn terms of complexity, for the rules neither is super complicated but IKI has a bit more going on than White Castle. As for the decision space, IKI also is a little more intricate I think.\\nI think a collection can easily have space for both games as they do different things despite both having themes related to Japan.\\n\\nThank you both Giacomo and Jon,\\nsince the other player is my girfriend I let her decide\\n\\nKeep in mind you\\'re asking on the White Castle forum. Answers are going to be skewed\\nGeneral theme aside they are much different games - rondel with shared incentives for Iki and dice placement + chaining turns in White Castle.\\nI much prefer Iki at all player counts.  It\\'s a little longer compared to White Castle, but by no means a long game.  Should be 90 minutes once you have the rules down.  I really like the stalls mechanic where you\\'re trying to incentivize players to visit your stall so you can level them up.  There\\'s some neat engine building with a touch of randomness from the fires to keep things .\\nI sold my copy of White Castle and Iki is still in the collection.

I wish I could say the same thing about White Castle and Iki. WC took about 8 plays before it began to make sense, and Iki about three.\\nYokohama is really quite straightforward - Go to the right market to collect resources (e.g. Fish market for fish, Bank for money), Fill orders. Get new orders and repeat. Once you have these basics down pat, open up to the Church, Customs House and Research station.\\nBe aware that the new Synapses edition stuffed up the 2p rules.

My wife and I and everyone we know on BGA really enjoy The White Castle…\\n\\nIs white castle on bga?\\n\\nNo it\\'s not. I just checked.\\n\\nI discovered both IKI and The White Castle at the CABS board game library at the Origins Game Fair in subsequent years, both games with two players.\\nIKI captured my imagination and made me more interested in Edo, its fires, its vendors, the Nihobanshi bridge, the use and value of pipes, the fish available at market in different seasons, the personalities of Edo (in the Akebono expansion), and economizing my actions in the game. I fell in love with it, and it’s my favorite game I’ve discovered in the past couple years. It tends to run 90 minutes for us.\\nThe White Castle didn’t do that for me. I was mostly interested in where my dice went, and at the end of the game I felt that switching the theme would not change the experience much. I thought the game itself was solid, apart from some issues interpreting the rulebook, and I would play it again. Yokohama is similar for me.\\nWhile I admire and enjoy abstract games with strong mechanics, the games I personally love most are those whose themes are as strong as their mechanics. I felt this with IKI. I very much feel this in Shogun (Dirk Henn) and Rising Sun.\\nBoth IKI and The White Castle are strong games with tight mechanics and agonizing decisions. You’ll probably enjoy both, but for me IKI is the one. No love lost between me and Devir, though.

You may find yourself looking up the pipes, the fires, the fish, and so on. I really like the Akebono expansion too, both for the additional historical themes and for the deeper strategic options.\\nSpeaking of expansions, I’m interested in trying the Matcha expansion for The White Castle, when it comes out.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlayed this for first time last night and really enjoyed it...\\nKudos on both production value and design!  Board is hard mount, wooden pieces, and thick cardboard.  Art is excellent and the theme ties everything together nicely.  The rulebook emphasizes that theme to a surprising and interesting degree...\\nThe 3 rounds of 3 actions makes for a reasonably quick game with a lot of meaningful decisions...\\nA few (mostly minor) quibbles with the game (based on only 1 play)...\\n1) The round maker (black dragon) and Turn Order markers are too big and unwieldy.  They tip over easily and obscure parts of the board.  Smaller would be better.\\n2) I was pretty unhappy with the balance of the starting positions.  I ended up being first player and got last pick, getting 2 flexible resources while my opponents got a fair bit more.  At start of game, quantity of resources appears much more important than flexibility.\\n3) Not sure I like the fact that the courtier promotions can\\'t be spit between 2...  Although I understand at least some of the rationale for that.\\n4) I consider the initiative track/VP balance to be problematic in 2 ways.  This was my only non-trivial issue with the game.\\n4a) The seal requirement feels like an unnecessary restriction given (4b)\\n4b) Pushing this track for serious VPs (10+) seems completely nonviable.  It takes 15+ moves on this track to get into the 10+ VP range.  With initiative pushes being either 1 or 2, you would have to commit essentially all your moves do just pushing this track to get into this range.\\nCompare this to placing 2 farmers (2 actions) in the right most farming spaces, giving 14 VPs.\\nIt feels like the the initiative track should either be shorter/more-compressed *or* there needs to be a way to move faster up the track.\\nAll in all, an excellent little game and I look forward to playing it again.\\n\\nThe point of the initiative track, believe it or not… is to try to gain (and retain) initiative.\\nThere definitely are certain set ups that makes it easier to move up on there than others, and without those seals toll payments a player could put very little efforts (to start and) stay in the lead.\\nWho knows, some testing might have occurred pre release and the VP compensation for spending some efforts moving up there has been calibrated so it remains an additional incentive, rather than a self-contained strategy?\\n\\nThe seal requirement feels like an unnecessary restriction given (4b)\\n4b) Pushing this track for serious VPs (10+) seems completely nonviable.

On our first play, I won with a score of 27, and felt like a genius.. until I realized there were 40/80+ VP tokens provided in the game (still uncertain about that 80 side, but for now I\\'ll assume it\\'s possible).\\nTo the point I quoted, the trick with this game is to:\\n1. Appreciate the set-up variance, and know\\nfor some sessions\\ncertain goals might be harder or easier to achieve. There is no possibility to gain an universal appreciation for how easy or difficult a thing would be to achieve in a single play configuration.\\n2. More importantly, combo\\'ing is **everything**. You rarely want to commit your action economy to influence gains, but gains as a byproduct of another action can be plentiful and nice.\\nAs to the the Daimyo seal cost, while I can see the game functioning fine without their inclusion, they\\'re easy enough to anticipate, and -- more importantly -- they create a secondary (or maybe tertiary) drain on the resource, which makes the inclusion of that resource more dynamic (i.e. more possible uses for a resource means more possible decisions to be made over the course of play -- in my book this is almost always a positive). Like in all things, a choice to use the seals for influence advancement means a trade off in other respects (resource availability, coin trades, extra actions from Castle room cards, etc).\\n\\nWhite Castle, more than any other game I\\'ve ever played, really demands repeat plays to understand.\\nOn our first play, I won with a score of 27, and felt like a genius.. until I realized there were 40/80+ VP tokens provided in the game (still uncertain about that 80 side, but for now I\\'ll assume it\\'s possible).\\n\\nThis. Absolutely this!\\nMy best score to date is 78, but I have hopes...\\nMost new games I play three times before I make an opinion on it one way or the other. I pushed that up to 8 for this game, and still don\\'t feel I have a handle on it. Though I am undeniably better.\\nOne thing I have decided is that using the initiative track to get points is a fool\\'s errand. I use it to get (or retain) first player privilege but otherwise ignore it. There are easier ways to get points.\\nOh and that round tracker is a fish. Not a dragon. Yes it is ridiculously big, but it doesn\\'t block anything that I recall. It is tucked away. The turn order herons are lovely, but agreed, somewhat problematic in that they block the score tracker in the early game.. We usually lay them down. They are too lovely to leave off.\\n\\n4b) Pushing this track for serious VPs (10+) seems completely nonviable.  It takes 15+ moves on this track to get into the 10+ VP range.

In most of my games, all players have ended up in the +3 points area, meaning no differentiation between them there. I have sometimes attempted to advance on the track as much as I could, but only achieved to waste other opportunities.\\nThat being said; in one game, a player actually maxed out on the initiative track, having to discard \"heron points\" in the end. Something that I until then had thought impossible to achieve. He ended up with an all time high of 111 points. We all (3 players) set personal records in that game, which obviously offered some profitable combos, plus unusually high die rolls. He didn\\'t use the track as a primary strategy, but advanced with combos with other actions.\\n\\nThat being said; in one game, a player actually maxed out on the initiative track, having to discard \"heron points\" in the end.

There\\'s a high degree of variability in the game stemming specially from the setup.\\n\\n\\n\\nSay I have 4 or 5 seals already and must receive 2 more. Is it legal to exchange my seals for coins or resources at this point so as not to lose excess seals?\\nI assume it\\'s allowed but wanted to double-check.\\n\\nIIRC, you may exchange seals at a any time.\\n\\nYes. Page 12 of the rulebook:\\n\\n(…)\\nat any moment during the game\\n, you can exchange 2 Daimyo Seals for 1 Resource of your choice (…) or exchange 1 Daimyo Seal for 1 coin. You may do this as many times as you wish.\\n\\nThanks.\\nI suppose the reason I had doubts is because in some games, similar exchanges are allowed only when\\nusing\\nresources or money to pay for something, so for example you would not be able to exchange seals for coins to keep these coins for later, only to instantly pay for an action.\\nI guess that is\\nnot\\nthe case in White Castle.\\n\\n\\n\\nHola!

Did I do that wrong?\\n\\nThat’s not correct. You can place at most 1  courtier, and/or move up 1 courtier (1 or 2 steps). Moving up Courtiers only get you access to resources through the light-coloured background (of the card you swap in your personal domain), no further placement would result from that.\\n\\nAh. Gotcha. Thanks. So only 1 placement and one move per die. Yeah that long combo felt too OP for me. Lol\\n\\nAh. Gotcha. Thanks. So only 1 placement and one move per die.

Pues no se paga\\nGracias por jugar!!\\n\\nGracias a vosotros por este juegazo que nos encanta\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, I got to play this little gem at Dice Tower Con East and it was an instant buy for me.  It fell into a “short-but-crunchy” category that not many games fall into for me.  Sure, there are some crunchy roll and writes out there but this was on another level than those.  I felt like I was playing an epic game in just over an hour.  When the game was over, I was honestly a bit disappointed because I wanted to play more.. and that is what we did.  A good game worth writing a review for is one that I immediately want to play again and this one is a shiny example!\\nBefore I go further, I want to take a moment to talk about how impressed I am with DEVIR as a publisher!  The quality of their games is outstanding and they hit a real sweet spot if thinky-yet-approachable that not many games do. My group spent a LOT of time chatting with Vlad at the DEVIR games exhibit and he truly has a passion for the company he works for.  My group played Lacrimosa, Red Cathedral, and White Castle and we loved each game!\\nOk, so back to White Castle; there is a ton of reply value here!  With different bonuses, worker placement spots, and many other little chits to switch out and move around this game keeps me coming back for me.  The game seems to be full of good choices which is refreshing to me.  Many games I end up going, “Well, all the good spots have been taken so I guess I’ll just take 2 coins..” but I never felt that way here.  Sure, some choices are better than others but if my plans ended up getting ruined due to another players move, I usually had another decent move I could do.  This made the game exciting because I always had something fun to do when my turn came around.\\nThere also appears to be no “one way” to win.  In many games I feel there seems to be a winning strategy.  “If you focus on moving up this one track you’ll win every time”.  I didn’t see that with White Castle.  All avenues of snagging points seemed balanced and every choice seemed to matter.\\nNeedless to say, this was a huge hit at Dice Tower Con East.  It seemed like every other table played this game at least once.  We even had a gal stop by just to explain the rules to us because she loved the game and wanted to know our thoughts when we were done.\\nAfter writing this review… I think I may just crack this game open and try the solo mode!\\n\\nAgreed. Once you get past the abysmal rulebook, it’s a really good game that doesn’t overstay its welcome. The production values are top notch too.\\n\\nI had zero problems with the rulebook.\\n\\nBefore I go further, I want to take a moment to talk about how impressed I am with DEVIR as a publisher!

When I first discovered Arkham Horror LCG and sat my sister down to play 12 hours straight, I assumed the tears in her eyes were of joy. The forced enthusiasm as I tried to make my in-laws memorize every symbol in Maracaibo was harder to explain away. And only when I finally sat my patient husband down to teach him Imperium: Horizons, did the words \"This will probably take us about three hours....\" die in my throat and make me take a hard look at myself. When did I become the annoying, nagging board game freak?\\nI don\\'t know how it feels to have a consistent board game group, but how it feels to not have a consistent board game group is that I need a board game for every occasion and every personality. I guess I\\'m in the stage of board gaming where I\\'ve explored most major genres, explored my likes and dislikes, and it\\'s not over but what is new and exciting is someone else\\'s \"gateway game moment\". It would seem Arkham Horror LCG is not that game...\\nHowever, I\\'m happy to announce I have found the solution! Introducing The White Castle, the Euro short enough to redeem your relationships. Now that I\\'ve pushed away all my friends and family, what better way to pull them back in than with a DIFFERENT board game?\\n\\nIf you\\'ve seen other reviews, you will have heard repeatedly, \"You only get 9 turns, that\\'s nothing!\", \"9 turns, can you believe it!?\", \"I\\'m just getting started!\". Yeah yeah, whatever. Go play a Lacerda game then. This is for us poor, sad gamers still trying to convert our loved ones. Now I don\\'t have to play Cards Against Humanity when I want a little social interaction. We\\'ve gotten 2-player just under an hour and really, under an hour is basically rounded down to 30 minutes so if you think about it, this game really only takes like 30 minutes. Say no more. Anyone can suffer for that long.\\nJokes aside, I have played this at 1, 2 and 4 players many times. Each time, I\\'ve received positive responses and I like each player count for different reasons. The solo mode is a lot of fun. The bot consistently scored in the 80s on \"easy\". I have yet to beat it but I have to assume the designers and playtesters could beat it regularly on \"easy\" at least. My highest score is like 57 so...I\\'m not that good at board games. I do love trying to beat my score each time, however. It\\'s short enough that I can develop a vision for my path through the game. I can\\'t do that with the longer Euros, where it all gets lost in the sauce for me.\\nAnyways, The White Castle is familiar. And the familiar is consumable. It tells us what we already understand. It makes us feel emotions we already know very well how to feel. And in a board game, I think that\\'s perfectly okay. Ultimately, I already grasp what\\'s underlying this and where it\\'s going for the next 60 minutes and that feels good. And what\\'s even better...it doesn\\'t overstay its welcome. I\\'m not sure there\\'s a lot of room for *yet another Euro*, but if you put it in a tiny box and give me a short play time, I\\'ll dance around to all my estranged family homes proclaiming I have the cure to their disease (not liking board games).\\nQuick pros and cons list:\\nPros\\n--Play time: wonderfully quick if you avoid the analysis paralysis trap of any Euro. Solo takes me about 40 minutes and 4 player was about 90 minutes.\\n--Solo mode: the bot is very quick so you can get back to your turn faster\\n--Beautiful artwork, very pleasing to look at and includes fun 3D dice bridges\\n--Combos feel very satisfying and you can get them going quickly\\nCons\\n--9 turns (this is a pro for me but perhaps a con for others)-you\\'ve got to be mathy if you want to improve, especially against the bot\\n--Sub-mechanics can feel removed from the theme\\n--Rivalry in blocking others from taking specific actions (I see this as fun interaction but others may see it as vicious)\\n\\nIf you enjoyed my review and want to see more, I\\'ve linked them in this\\n\\nGeekList\\n\\nfor easy access.\\n\\n\" the cure to their disease (not liking board games).\"\\n\\nDid you find the solo mode unbalanced?

The only times I come close, it has to do with the random nature of the cards in play on the board, which doesn\\'t feel particularly fair. There is a solo mode variant here on BGG that I haven\\'t tried but seems pretty universally praised. You might give that a try.\\n\\nDid you find the solo mode unbalanced?\\n\\n\"Challenging!\" We call that \"challenging\"!\\n\\nDid you find the solo mode unbalanced?\\n\\n\"Challenging!\" We call that \"challenging\"!\\n\\nLol I like this word for an optimistic view!

There\\'s just a very good chance you\\'ll lose a lot!\\n\\nDid you find the solo mode unbalanced?\\n\\n\"Challenging!\" We call that \"challenging\"!\\n\\nLol I like this word for an optimistic view!

I was only able to score 31 points…it scored 67. I don’t know how I could have stacked actions more, but it seems that’s the only way to beat the bot in easy.

None of them ever says, \"what if...?\" or \"Can I...?\"\\nIt\\'s not like it would cost you more than a six-pack of sodas and a large pizza to get four random gamers at the FLGS to blind play test your design?

In the early 21st century the email-only\\n\\nLaws Mailing List was in effect a years-long blind play test of the 1997 rulebook with zillions of playtesters from different bridge cultures across the world.

Cheers folks. Lol\\n\\n\\n\\nI want to know what kind of variants you guys used to make the game became more interesting? I heard some of you tried adding 4th round to ramp up the existing engine. From me, maybe I want to make initial resources chosen manually since in solo rules, I must pick a random starting resource. I want to here your ideas and maybe I would try to do it at some point. Appreciates every comments here.\\n\\nI personally find the rules as written \"fun and interesting\".\\n\\nI have been working on my own homegrown solo variant, as I find the official one pretty barebone. One aspect I paste herein may be of interest to you since it covers that random starting resource aspect, which I am definitely not a fan of.\\n—-\\nStarting Cards:\\nDepending on the difficulty level desired  deal pairs of resource/action cards randomly as follows:\\nEASY: 3\\nMEDIUM: 2\\nHARD: 1\\nSelect your own starting pair of cards as you see fit and return the rest of the cards to the box.\\n—-\\n… this is part of a much more involved setup, but the rest only makes sense in the context of that variant, which I may publish here one day, after finding some more time to refine it.\\n\\nI personally find the rules as written \"fun and interesting\".\\n\\nI agree, I think it\\'s been so different every game because of how varied the setup is and how the dice rolls drastically change each game. It\\'s also been fun to play at different player counts. If I ever get to the point of wanting variants I\\'d probably just not randomize the setup and make sure every room on the first floor has only 2 colored actions, and customize the training yard and well tiles.\\n\\nAt 3 player count, I usually let to stack dices just one time per horizontal layer (per round). I think this way is more similar to the other player counts\\n\\n\\n\\nLike the title said, I need to make sure I\\'m doing it right. So help me confirm some of the rules that I felt that I misunderstood. Mainly on solo and also on Gingkogawa AI.\\n1. Can the gardeners be activated from any place in any order (not from top to down)?\\n2. Since it\\'s said that I started from the gate, did I have to empty AI\\'s courtiers that\\'s still on the gate to the 1st (or 2nd) floor or it\\'s on me to decide?\\n3. On Gingkogawa AI, when all three spots on 1st floor have 2 color of a die, it says I need to check from the left to right. Was the \"left\" here literally the leftmost spot or the one that\\'s indicated by AI\\'s scheme cards?\\nThanks for the responses.\\n\\n1. Yes. But you cannot activate new Gardners in this phase(you do get the placing a Gardner bonus, just not twice between rounds).\\n\\n\\n\\nI have probably >20 plays of White Castle under my belt now, and have always played that gardeners activate at the end of round ONLY if dice left is on THEIR side of the bridge.

I can totally see how you might you misremember “farmers only produce if there are dice on their bridge” as “farmers only produce if there are dice on their side of their bridge.”\\n\\nOne thing I\\'m still not 100% clear on is activating your Domain.   We played most of a game what that works allow to place a meeple of that lane, in addition to uncovered resources,  and the card action on the right.\\nReading again,  I don\\'t think you are supposed to take a meeple action,  but the icon on the left of each row is confusing....\\n\\nI did this exact same thing for my first 10 games.\\nIt wasn\\'t until I saw someone correct another person on here that I realized.\\n\\nOne thing I\\'m still not 100% clear on is activating your Domain.

I agree it\\'s the rule (I too thought a die had to be on your side of the bridge). I haven\\'t played TWC enough to know whether this makes the gardener strategy the obvious one compared to courtier and warrior.\\n\\ndoes it not make the gardeners the only strategy to go for in the first round otherwise you are missing out on those extra actions?\\n\\nThe short answer is \"no, it doesn\\'t\". This game is not \"broken\", it doesn\\'t have a single solid strategy that you have to repeat every time. You can win without gardeners in the first round, you can lose with them. To really win you need to see combos, and create and use opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\nI accidentally packed into the lid, and only in doing that realised just HOW WELL it fits. Has anyone else noticed this?\\nYou can put the cards or dice sensibly into the bottom layer (next to the main board).\\nWhat are the chances that the production team used the lid dimensions instead of the base when they were planning?\\n\\nThat wouldn\\'t surprise me. It\\'s funny how many games have game or player boards that are just too big to sit neatly across a box so they end up wasting space by needing to be laid lengthways. And you think: surely someone spotted this in production?\\nI almost got TWC out to test your hypothesis. Then thought of trying to get all the bits back in again. So didn\\'t. (TWC is actually two games in one: (1) the game (2) get everything back in again.)\\n(But did you then manage to get the base on and store the game upside down? Presumably not. So you have a dilemma: store the lid upside down with the game inside but no top so it needs to go at the top of the games stack. Or...... Or what!?)\\n\\nI accidentally packed into the lid, and only in doing that realised just HOW WELL it fits. Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\nYES! I did exactly this myself the first time I packed it away - put everything into the lid without noticing, congratulated myself on how I’d got everything to fit so well, wondered what everyone else was making such a fuss about, and then realised my mistake when I couldn’t use the base as a lid.\\nTo be honest I don’t find it so hard getting everything to fit into the base either, but you do need to have a fairly exact plan.\\n\\nTo be honest I don’t find it so hard getting everything to fit into the base either, but you do need to have a fairly exact plan.\\n\\nKey thing for me was realizing you can use the bridges to store the dice.\\n\\nTo be honest I don’t find it so hard getting everything to fit into the base either, but you do need to have a fairly exact plan.\\n\\nKey thing for me was realizing you can use the bridges to store the dice.\\n\\nI think you mistyped the word must as can.\\n\\nTo be honest I don’t find it so hard getting everything to fit into the base either, but you do need to have a fairly exact plan.\\n\\nKey thing for me was realizing you can use the bridges to store the dice.\\n\\nI think you mistyped the word must as can.\\n\\nI don’t store the dice that way but I do get everything to fit.\\n\\nI keep seeing people talking about this not fitting back into the box and for some reason I seem to have zero issues with it.\\nNon sleeved cards (whats the point, they\\'re hardly being handled), everything in baggies, bridges are left assembled.\\nMaybe I should do a photo-blog showing how I pack it in haha\\n\\nYeh I too have no issue with getting it all back in the box.\\n\\nSame for me.

I’ve stashed mine\\n\\ncool. but it would only be good for 2 players.\\n\\nI posted the original photos of these bridges and can confirm they only work for two players, at least with dice out of the box. Other than that they are almost a perfect fit in regards to length and width. The dice fit nice and snug, but not too much so. I don\\'t think getting smaller dice would work, so yes these are only for two but, they work! My wife is my primary gaming partner, and I\\'ve got the originals should the need arise.\\n\\nWhile the bridges give a great table presence, I find they are less practical than placing the dice directly on the board. I no longer use them when I am playing at home - that\\'s nearly all my plays.\\n\\nJust pointing out thst the expansion seems to have a bridge as well so if you are going to upgrade maybe wait to see any info about the expansion (or get 4).\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is base game, haven\\'t tried any variants.

So excited to play it again today after work.\\n\\nNope, they don\\'t take it - just ignore. Their dice placements only ever give them coins for the pip difference and block you.\\n\\nYou can play infinite dice in the well so can\\'t be blocked\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t understand very well the rules about point with coins on the last round for the automa, at the ending games. The automa wins or not points with its coins at the end of the third round when the ending points game is made?\\n\\nNo because it should\\'ve traded in its coins after the 3 round for points at that point\\n\\nThat sounds like the equivalent of a yes, right? The Automa gets points for its coins as part of the final scoring. Only once, after the end of the third round.\\n\\nEnd of round is distinct from end of game scoring. You convert coins to points at the end of rounds. Then there is nothing left to convert, as noted T the top of page 18.\\n\\nSo the third round has a ending round so the bot wins points for its coins. And then, i do the ending game final scoring?\\n\\nyes.\\n\\nThe  automa gain points for its gardners at the end of third round/game?\\n\\n\\n\\nPlayed for the first time yesterday, so I might just have missed it.\\nWhen picking up a level 1 or 2 card with the a courtier, am I allowed to check what lantern bonus is on the back side before choosing?\\n(despite the fact that this is technically hidden trackable information from the time of placing the card in the castle)\\n\\nHi!

The box is tight, sleeved cards or not.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\n\\nHello.\\nTell me, can I place a nobleman at the castle gate and then lift him to the second floor room?\\nOr should he first enter the first floor?\\n\\nIt depends on how much Mother of Pearl you have. You always start by placing him at the gate, but if you spend 2 pearl you can then move him up one additional level or floor. If you have 5 pearl, you can move him up two floors.\\n\\nМожешь, конечно, если 5 жемчуга есть. Стратегически лучше поднимать на первый, чтобы забрать на планшет карту, которая будет монеты генерить, когда сама уйдет в Фонарь. А с первого можно прыгнуть сразу на последний потом.\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nIt depends on how much Mother of Pearl you have. You always start by placing him at the gate, but if you spend 2 pearl you can then move him up one additional level or floor. If you have 5 pearl, you can move him up two floors.\\n\\nJust to be clear; you (may) spend $2 to place a courier in the gate, then you (may) spend either 2/5 mother of pearl to move a single courtier up 1/2 levels within the castle. It does not have to be the same courtier you just placed in the gate.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan you move your courtiers and then pay coins to place one. The rulebook doesn\\'t say if you can do them in any order tnx\\n\\nI could be wrong but I\\'m pretty sure it does say you can do them in any order\\nEdit: ok just looked and it doesn\\'t specify! Wow, this rulebook really is bad for such a simple game. Anyway I\\'m 99.99% sure you can do them in either order\\n\\nSince you can do either action independently there’s no reason to assume you’d have to do them in any particular order if you choose to do both. Go ahead and collect those coins to send a new one to the gate!\\n\\nYes, you can use coins to place a couturier at the gate and then use your mother of pearl to move a different courtier, or vice versa.\\n\\nYes the rulebook really isn\\'t the best. Especially since I thought red cathedral had a pretty good one\\n\\nYes the rulebook really isn\\'t the best.\\n\\nThe player aid cards are\\nparticularly\\nuseless.\\n\\nBut at least they gave you four copies of the rulebook…\\n\\nBut at least they gave you four copies of the rulebook…\\n\\nI could be wrong, but I thought it was five?\\n\\nBut the 2 coins and place your Courtier is a must do action, right?\\n\\nBut the 2 coins and place your Courtier is a must do action, right?\\n\\nNo. It says you can do either of the actions or both, so you can just do the second one (pay mother-of-pearl to move a Courier up).\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my first games, I misunderstood the rule for the courtiers. I took two actions every time - no matter which one. This often gave me a good advantage with more courtiers and more resources. If I want to have better chances, I now use my earlier mistake as a house rule. Maybe that\\'s something for you too.\\n\\nCan you confirm what you mean by two actions.  It sounds like something good.\\n\\nThe correct rule when using two actions is to place one courtier for coins and to move one courtier for mother of pearl. I wrote above: \"I took two actions every time - no matter which one.\" This means that - in addition to the correct rule - I have either placed two courtiers (for four coins) or moved two courtiers for the required amount of mother of pearl.\\n\\nSo you actually did 4 actions; the two permitted and then another double of one of the permitted!.  That would be good.\\n\\nSo you actually did 4 actions; the two permitted and then another double of one of the permitted!.  That would be good.\\n\\nNo. Only two actions. As described above.\\n\\nOh, I see.  Not in addition, but any two of the permitted actions.  I can still see that could be good.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo in solo mode, if I move the Automa\\'s die to the well because the castle spot is already occupied, does the Automa receive the difference of the well action? (So 5 coins if it would place a 6?)\\n\\nYes, it does\\n\\n\\n\\nI made an insert (using 30pt chipboard) since I was having trouble fitting everything back in the box. Honestly, lining up the meeples by itself is a big space saver. The player boxes hold all the meeples, the resource cubes, the fan token, and the influence marker, but not the crane. The solo cards are bagged and stacked on top of all the other cards (all cards sleeved). The coins and another set of dice are below the player aids, next to the game board.\\n\\n\\n\\nall the rulebooks can fit without lid lift!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy keep more than one rulebook? First thing I do with Devir games is throw away 7 rulebooks, and then suddenly I have PLENTY of room.\\n\\nWell that\\'s a game in itself. I don\\'t think I\\'ll bother to play TWC - just get everything out of the box and fit it all back in again. If I do that with my wife it\\'s MP. On my own it\\'s solo.

I think\\n\\nthis is the right url\\n\\nbut it\\'ll only be available when it\\'s been approved.\\n\\nThanks so much!\\n\\n\\n\\nOr is it limited to 1 meeple per action?\\n\\nYou can only take each action once. That is place one meeple and/or promote one meeple.\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\nIf you like making up the rules, you can\\n\\nFWIW; it’s a two part action. E.G. placing a courtier in the gate for $2 is the first half of the action, promoting a courtier up 1/2 levels for 2/5 pearls is the second half.\\nYou don’t have to promote the courtier you put in the gate. You can’t split the move up two levels between two different courtiers. You may voluntarily choose to not to do one half or the other of the action. E.G. not put a courtier in the gate, or not promote a courtier.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am looking to use some redundant metal coins for this game, and I wondered how many you actually need.

Each different take on worker placement will appeal to slightly different audiences. One thing I really like about TWC is that there\\'s enough variation from game to game and from round to round, that it\\'s a puzzle you must keep solving. You can\\'t expect to just recycle the same strategy every time, you have to adapt. Now, there isn\\'t a\\nton\\nof content to explore in the base game, so you get a quick feel for the different ways the game can play out (even though the puzzle is always shifting, it won\\'t always shift in drastic degrees), but the upcoming expansion adds more actions and a new worker (with new scoring).\\n\\nI\\'ve been looking into this game.

Is thier certain strategies that you will always go with simply because it\\'s the best\\n\\nJust from this one post I\\'d say don\\'t buy it. This isn\\'t your average worker placement game - this is a VERY tight and restrictive game, one where naysayers say they feel constrained in their sense of agency.\\nThose of us that love this love it for precisely the same reason; the sense of extreme optimization necessary to play well is unique, but not for everybody..\\n\\nI might be dumb, but what does \"On rials\" mean?\\n\\nIt means a game where your actions are decided for you - you\\'re not free to explore the theme park in any direction, but have to sit on the little train and take it in \"on rails,\" like early theme parks. That isn\\'t this game. In a gamer sense, it generally points to games where there is one best option at any one time, leading you to be guided by the nose through the play experience.\\nTo be clear, while I do think this is a tight and restrictive game, there are always multiple options. The restriction comes from the paucity of actions over the course of play (only 9 core actions every game, 3 per turn.. but combos are available, and that is what opens the game up at times).\\n\\nI can confirm I adore this game for the constraint and planning  needed.  In a two player game you can be blocked.  Often there are ways to get the action your wanted but maybe not with the other items that might of come from the action spot you got blocked from.  The puzzle does change each game and what resources are more or less available changes some each game too.  Yet there is balance in it.  But yeah, we finish and my brain is so happy, win or loose.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this ceremonial video, we present the 2023 Game Court Awards. We have selected and awarded 14 games that were published in 2023 and excelled in different categories, but we also present 3 special awards!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you remove a worker from your player board track, do you immediately get to collect all the resources that have been revealed in that row? What about also doing the action in that row?\\nI was taught by someone who had been playing that way and I was just curious. Thanks for clarifying!\\n\\nNo, when removing a worker from your player board, you\\ndo not\\ngain any resources from that worker\\'s resource track. You only gain those resources when either placing a die on your board for that row, or gaining the special action showing a multi-colored die and 3 banners; this lets you activate your personal domain board as though you had placed a die.\\n\\nNope, the benefit revealed by the worker you just placed has no immediate effect. You\\'ll only gain the printed benefit once you perform the corresponding Personal Domain action - either by placing a dice on that row\\'s space, or by getting a \"Personal Domain\" action otherwise in the main board.\\nIf you\\'re placing a worker as the result of a Personal Domain action, you don\\'t get that revealed benefit neither. You perform the action from left to right, so by the time you\\'re placing the worker (card action at the end of the row), you\\'ve already gone past those rewards.\\nThe rulebook illustrates the flow well enough, in my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\nSorry, I couldn\\'t find this answer when searching.  When you select the lowest numbered die you get a lantern bonus, but does this happen before or after placing the die?\\nFor example, if I don\\'t have any coins, but my lantern bonus gives me one, and I need that coin to pay the cost for the die placement, am I still allowed to take that die and put it where I want?\\n\\nSorry, I couldn\\'t find this answer when searching.

I didn’t see that order called out but I guess I didn’t look close enough. Cheers!\\n\\nThanks! I didn’t see that order called out but I guess I didn’t look close enough. Cheers!\\n\\nIt\\'s on pages 4-5 of the rulebook, where it explains \"Using the Dice.\"\\n\\nAlso the game comes with 4 \"player aid\" cards that show the sequence.\\n\\n\\n\\nI played the first time last night and really like the game, but I got a bit confused on the die tile setup, and feel like the instructions are way overcomplicated with the numbering.\\nIsn\\'t the idea just that on the first floor you can\\'t have 3 of the same color and on the second floor you can\\'t have 2 of the same color?  I mistakenly thought the diamond spaces weren\\'t applicable for 2P like it says about the cards.  What am I missing?\\n\\nI played the first time last night and really like the game, but I got a bit confused on the die tile setup, and feel like the instructions are way overcomplicated with the numbering.\\nIsn\\'t the idea just that on the first floor you can\\'t have 3 of the same color and on the second floor you can\\'t have 2 of the same color?  I thought the diamond space wasn\\'t applicable for 2P like it says about the cards.  What am I missing?\\n\\nThe diamond spaces are applicable to the two player game, it’s just the cards with diamonds on them that aren’t.\\nYou’re basically right about the mix of colours, except the extra rule (“Randomly take one of each color and place them in each of the 3 spaces marked <with a diamond>”) exists to ensure that there are a spread of colours amongst those places too - you have to have a different colour for each.\\n\\nFor a game that came with four 20 page rulebooks, they sure are poorly written.\\n\\nFor a game that came with four 20 page rulebooks, they sure are poorly written.\\n\\nHAAAARD disagree.\\n\\nI wonder the same thing every time I’m setting up. The first part of ensure 3 different colors on the 3 marked spaces makes sense to distribute evenly. Then after that it could just be randomly put out die tiles, and if they’re all the same color in any space, replace one until it’s different. Why put them out in specific order? And then the bit about skipping this number if it’s the same and so on, I don’t see why any of that is necessary and makes it feel unnecessarily complicated. Figured I must be missing something but based on this thread, maybe not.\\n\\nI thought the diamond space wasn\\'t applicable for 2P like it says about the cards.\\n\\nyes, while that’s not the case, it’s unfortunate the iconography implies it. Especially since I am pretty sure the ‘hand holding’ procedural nature of the setup is there for only one reason: avoid messing up the distribution on the very first game.\\n\\nFor a game that came with four 20 page rulebooks, they sure are poorly written.\\n\\nYeah, the biggest problem is there isn’t a page that describes the components. So you see all these names and you don’t know WTF they’re talking about. Other than that it is solid, and it includes a bunch of examples which helps.\\n\\n… except the extra rule (“Randomly take one of each color and place them in each of the 3 spaces marked <with a diamond>”) exists to ensure that there are a spread of colours amongst those places too - you have to have a different colour for each.\\n\\nGood point, thanks!\\n\\nPersonally, I also found the procedural method a bit over-complicated at first. But once I realized what it was doing, I found that it really streamlined the setup process.\\nSure, the rules could have just said, \"Make sure each room has at least two different colors of Die tiles.\" Then everyone would be free to interpret how to do the setup as they please. But by giving the players a step-by-step way to do this setup, there is at least a prescribed method that can be used. Some players will just follow the spirit of the rules no matter what they say, and perform setup however they like. Some players want to be told precisely how to set up the game. I think the rules as written give each end of the spectrum a way to handle setup.\\nNow, I find it a lot easier just to follow the method as written in the rules because it really simplifies the process.\\nI don\\'t think the OP \"missed\" anything regarding the Die tile setup. What the OP missed was that the diamond shapes (in different colors and, arguably, facing different directions) meant different things in different steps of the setup. Admittedly, different shapes could have been used to differentiate the meaning better.\\nWe all make assumptions and miss things when reading rules for the first time. That\\'s why I recommend a careful reading of the rules before playing. If that\\'s not possible, then read the rules out loud to the players. Then everyone is hearing the same thing, and if something isn\\'t clear, someone will say something. (Maybe you just misread it. Who knows?)\\nLastly, when commenting on how rules are written, consider an alternative way they could have been written. It can be a lot harder than you think to be clear, precise, and simple all at the same time. Hopefully, the author of the rulebook has already considered multiple ways to express the rules, and has settled on the clearest, least complicated, most precise way of expressing them.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy wife and I love the game and so we play it quite often. But there is one thing. Some people talking about over 70 or 80 Point. My wife and I barely getting 40 in our plays. Is it depending on the number of players? Or do we overlook sth.?\\nThanks in advance to all your answers.\\n\\nHi,\\nI\\'ve just played times. And we got score like you.\\n\\nIt really depends on the random token layout at the beginning of the game. If there\\'s potential for more combos, scores will be naturally higher. If someone gets 80pts and someone 35 in the same game, then there\\'s just an inexperience between them. 40 a game is not a bad score, as long as everyone is getting the same amount\\n\\nHi!\\nI’m one of the designers of the game my average scoring is about 70 points. And my best score is 82 without expansion\\nIsra’s average is around 70 pv also.\\nThanks for playing!!!\\n\\nIf someone gets 80pts and someone 35 in the same game, then there\\'s just an inexperience between them.\\n\\nI’m not sure I’d agree a large gap between the scores necessarily indicates inexperience from one side. There is a real opportunity cost that can result from certain setups, sometimes in favour of the player going first, sometimes the second. In those circumstances close scores actually point to the disparity in skills. That said, scores below 40 should IMO be considered poor no matter the setup.\\n\\nMy wife and I barely getting 40 in our plays. Is it depending on the number of players? Or do we overlook sth.?\\n\\nMy best guess is that you should look for more combos. In an average game I\\'m able to put out 12 workers in 9 rounds, 1.3 meeple per round or 4 meeples every 3 turns. So if you make a set of moves that don\\'t put out enough meeples, you\\'re probably loosing the pace. \"Well action\", for example, shouldn\\'t be taken in most cases, you activate the well from other cards.\\nGeneral advice is to put out gardeners first to get two between-round activations. And then find a balanced way to put out samurai and courtiers.\\nSamurai usually are a great way to start combo and moving the courtiers usually concludes the combo and gives resources for the next turn.\\nAnother approach is to start with courtiers to have a huge lantern bonus, so you will have a lot of money and resources/seals. In this case gardeners will also trigger a combo.\\nWe can play on TTS if you want to ask questions and see how other people play. This game is deep and mid-paced, so rushing doesn\\'t give a lot of output.\\n\\nHi!\\nI’m one of the designers of the game my average scoring is about 70 points. And my best score is 82 without expansion\\nIsra’s average is around 70 pv also.\\nThanks for playing!!!\\n\\nI thought you score like 120 every game! Pleased to see that we\\'re on par\\nAnd let me take this moment to congratulate you and Isra on what you\\'re expecting this summer. I\\'m so glad for you, guys! All my best wishes and thanks for your masterpieces!\\n\\nIn an average game I\\'m able to put out 12 workers in 9 rounds,\\n\\nI absolutely agree with that. Aiming to put out one worker each turn, and either one through Gardener end of turn or combo on back on at least one regular turn each round is key… turns that just serve to gather resources, no matter how productive, should be rare and forced on you, not a voluntary choice.\\n(my 2 cents after not that many games, but all scoring between 50-70 pts).\\n\\nWow, I\\'m impressed.

Can the action be activated again if a die is already in that space?\\n\\nYes to both.\\nWhen stacking dice, the color of the bottom dice is irrelevant. It\\'s only the face value that matters for changing the cost of that action space.\\n\\nAs said, yes. It can be a bit hard to wrap your head around.\\nYour first example think of it giving you a virtual blank/numberless die of any color to trigger any castle space of that color (even with two dice stacked already).\\nYour second question is then a virtual courtier in any castle space.\\n\\nYour second question is then a virtual courtier in any castle space.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what you mean by \"virtual courtier\". My understanding is that you don\\'t need a courtier in the castle to take castle actions. I thought any player can take any castle action by just placing the appropriate die. Am I mistaken?\\n\\nJason, you\\'re correct. Rob was just painting a picture to help others assimilate those rules. You don\\'t need a courtier anywhere to take a Castle action – i.e. actions associated with cards in the first 2 castle floors.\\n\\nThank you Mario!\\n\\nJason, you\\'re correct.

There\\'s no picture of this example. But after rereading the rules I see that this is not specified.... So we could stack 2 dice of the same colour?\\nThank you in advance for removing this doubt.\\n\\nSure can. As you said, no reason you couldn\\'t\\n\\nThank You !\\n\\n\\n\\nAny chance of someone doing a solo playthrough video using the gingkogawa variant?\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, I was extremely hesitant to buy this game. We did not like The Red Cathedral. There was not much interaction to our taste, the dice drafting mechanism wasn\\'t to our liking, and never left us with a feeling of wanting more. So, cannot be helped, I got a bit biased about TWC, but followed the game\\'s page to see what people think.\\nYesterday I decided to buy the game, and I already feel this is much more what we like.\\nDice drafting is very clever in this game.\\nYou benefit from both larger and smaller dice, but in a different way. You need to think twice about where you take your dice from, as you might prevent your opponent (or even yourself!) from a gardener action. The placement itself kinda reminds me of Lorenzo Il Magnifico somehow.\\nMassive decisions.\\nNot many actions, but you can get long chains and insane combos. This bit reminds me of Pulsar 2849, although combos are a lot scarcer there.\\nInteraction.\\nFinally. I love the way you influence the other player(s) in which die you take, where do you put it, what\\'s your position on the passage of time, which cards you claim from the castle, etc. This is exactly the feature of a crunchy euro!\\nSo all in all, we are very happy with this game. After our first playthrough, we want more and is most probably a keeper. 9/10 for now.\\n\\nMy conclusions too, Including the partial comparison with\\n\\n, which I was also hesitant to play and also enjoyed a lot, to my surprise.. (\\n\\nfans like me are likely to enjoy these two much tighter dice placement games…)\\n\\nThe only complaint I might have about this game is three rounds seems a bit short. The game ends right when you’re building up combos. I heard an interesting house rule of adding a fourth “Winter Season” consisting of a single die per player. I plan on trying it out next time.\\n\\nThe expansion will generate another dice each per round, so you\\'ll be sorted\\n\\nSounds great, although I personally have no problem with the tight nature of the game.\\nTake Earth as an example - I know, completely different genre, but the game just gives, gives and gives even more, without any challenge towards the players. No matter what you do, you\\'ll get points and this is extremely bland IMO.\\nSo having a tight euro with great mechanics is probably be destined to flourish.\\n\\nSounds great, although I personally have no problem with the tight nature of the game.\\nTake Earth as an example - I know, completely different genre, but the game just gives, gives and gives even more, without any challenge towards the players.

Whatever \"weight\" means, it applies to teaching this game to Irene.  Our \"heavy\" games include Troyes, Grand Austria, Lorenzo and Obsession.  I\\nthink\\nthat the game flow, art and limited number of turns will win her over.  If a game goes on too long, she compares it to making ham salad with a manual meat grinder, more cathartic than entertaining.\\n\\nI think I still prefer Red Cathedral to White Castle, but both are excellent games. Happy to have them in my collection!\\n\\nOh wow! From the comments I have seen, you appear to be in the minority. Can you expand upon why you prefer Red Cathedral?\\n\\nWhatever \"weight\" means, it applies to teaching this game to Irene.\\n\\nHey Gary, just as a comparison, I’d put this way down the list of complexity, comparing to the other titles you mention.\\nI found the WC rulebook hard for me to parse and absorb, and I did much better with this play-through to ‘get’ the game elements better.\\n\\nAfter that first play it clicks how approachable this game really is. There aren’t a tremendous number of facets to the game.\\n-----------------\\nIn general terms, here are my thoughts comparing RC & WC.\\nWe’re in the camp of far preferring WC. RC just didn’t stick with my wife. She doesn’t really like games with variable ending, preferring set rounds and she didn’t do well with the area majority scoring either. She’ll play it but doesn’t really like it.\\nFor me I like the base elements of RC but it is a little too simple for my tastes. I see this is an entry level to mid-eight games if that makes sense. I prefer it with the expansion to give it some umph, but my wife liked it even less with it in.\\nRegarding WC, I was surprised how my wife took to that right away from the very first play. We are 5 games in and she’s still enjoying it. I like this much better as well, having a little more depth of play, but it still falls short of a top-tier dicey Euro for me. I’m finding the variability to be more a bug than a feature.\\nIt’s one thing to deal with tight resources, I like that challenge in a game, but to have tight action spaces can be frustrating. I had several turns where the action I want to do is simply not available. Maybe in a game with more than 9 turns that would be easier to take. I also think, due to this it adds to the AP, of trying to find combos that just might not be there.\\nStill, the game obviously doesn’t outstay it’s welcome and I am enjoying it, at the same time. I am very hopeful that the upcoming\\n\\nexpansion\\n\\n, kicks it up my list of top dicey Euros.\\n\\nRed cathedral its a middle eurogame, its my devirs personal top but white castle appart from being pushed by media; also has thats is an advanced eurogame that resolves in short time and its easier to get into.\\nThe magic of white castle is that it invites casual and new players to a new level of eurogaming without a hard learning curve as other games.\\nIts a matter of timming respect the general customers, the harvest from the pandemic generation.\\n\\nwas very well received when it was released.

However, there\\'s an example image that shows the coin value in red, which is the typical iconography for a mandatory cost.\\nAppreciate the clarification!\\n\\nYes, you have to pay the coin difference to place the die.\\n\\nIt seems a reasonable question to me, and it\\'s not explicit in the rules.\\nI am 95% sure Isra will come along to confirm / give a thumbs up:  I think the intent is that you MUST be able to pay the full cost before placing a die -- otherwise you cannot place the die there.\\n\\nIt\\'s detailed in the section right below it, \"Gaining and Paying Coins.\"\\n\\nA red-colored number together with the coin or Daimyo Seal icon indicates that you must\\npay\\nthe indicated amount in order to gain or perform what is indicated by the arrow.\\n\\nYeah I assume you can only place the die if you can pay the full cost, but I figured I\\'d check\\n\\nIt\\'s detailed in the section right below it, \"Gaining and Paying Coins.\"\\n\\nA red-colored number together with the coin or Daimyo Seal icon indicates that you must\\npay\\nthe indicated amount in order to gain or perform what is indicated by the arrow.\\n\\nRight but that section was discussing the iconography of \"gaining or performing what is indicated by the\\narrow\\n\" in the context of palace action spaces, so I wanted to make sure the same principle applied to the above section about dice.\\n\\nIt\\'s detailed in the section right below it, \"Gaining and Paying Coins.\"\\n\\nA red-colored number together with the coin or Daimyo Seal icon indicates that you must\\npay\\nthe indicated amount in order to gain or perform what is indicated by the arrow.\\n\\nRight but that section was discussing the iconography of \"gaining or performing what is indicated by the\\narrow\\n\" in the context of palace action spaces, so I wanted to make sure the same principle applied to the above section about dice.\\n\\nThat section is titled, \"Gaining and Paying Coins and Daimyo Seals.\" It\\'s not exclusive to iconography. In order to keep the rulebook as short as possible, they definitely took some shortcuts that maybe they shouldn\\'t have, but I see no reason to think this section is somehow different than when gaining or paying coins from die placement.

It now says:\\n\\nPerform a\\nPersonal Domain\\naction, as if you had placed a die of value 6 in one of your 3 die spaces. You cannot trigger the exact same line more than once in a single turn (see page 8).\\n\\nSo, it seems the designers (at least of the English language rule book) intend that the bonus Domain action must be for a row that has not yet triggered this round (edit: by this bonus). I\\'m guessing that is to prevent players from getting too many bonus actions off their Domain card.\\nEdit after additional reading: In the\\n\\nthread\\n\\ndescribing the addition of that sentence to the rules, the designers state that the limitation only applies to additional triggers from this icon.\\nYou can activate a given line up to twice per turn, once via die placement, once via the Personal Domain icon.\\n\\nThe designers have disclosed already that this clarification would be included in future printings. You can find their comments\\n\\nhere\\n\\nand\\n\\nhere\\n\\n.\\nYou can activate the same personal board action once by placing a dice on the board, and an additional time through the Warrior action (dependent on setup – yard tiles) in the same turn. You cannot trigger the exact same line of your Personal Domain through that specific Yard Tile again in the same turn.\\nIt is\\nirrelevant\\nwhether that particular row has been activated in a earlier turn that round - i.e. there being a dice on the row already. You just can\\'t benefit from a loop with\\nmultiple cascading\\nactivations of the same row.\\n\\nIt\\'s been awhile since I\\'ve played, but still a bit confused.\\nWe have this:\\n\\nand the designers said to add \"When applying this icon add this sentence to the rulebook: You cannot trigger the exact same line again in a single turn.\"\\nSo you are saying you can activate the same personal board action once by placing a dice and if possible thru the an action with the icon above (it\\'s basically a virtual die and doesn\\'t matter if that personal board action has a die by it).\\nHowever, you couldn\\'t that board action a third time in that turn if something else provided that icon too?\\n\\nSorry, Jason. I wasn\\'t able to parse 100% of what you said there\\nOn your turn, you pick a dice and perform a dice action - the one associated with the space you placed your dice on.\\nOne such space in the one printed in your player board, the Personal Domain action (p. 8). You place a dice there and the action consists of gaining all the revealed benefits in the associated row, plus gaining the corresponding benefits or triggering the corresponding action on your card.\\nSay you do the coral row of your personal domain action on turn 1 of round 1. That dice will remain there throughout the whole round 1. Let\\'s assume the corresponding action on your card is a Warrior action.\\nOn your turn 2 of that same round 1, you place a dice on a Gardener action space. You then place a gardener on a garden that allows you to pay \"x\" to\\ntrigger\\na Personal Domain action. You\\'re absolutely free to choose that same row associated with the coral dice - and that dice is still sitting there as we\\'re still on round 1.\\nNow let\\'s say you trigger that exact same row, and by some happy coincidence you manage to place a new warrior with the Warrior action in your card at the end of the coral line. Say you place that warrior on a Training Yard that also has the Personal Domain icon. You\\'ll get to\\ntrigger\\nanother personal domain action.\\nHowever, since in that same\\nturn 2\\nyou just\\ntriggered\\nthat coral row (via the Gardener action), you cannot trigger it again!\\nIt has nothing to do with\\nperforming\\nthe personal domain action by placing a dice in your player board. It\\'s all about\\ntriggering\\na single row in your player board a 2nd time in a\\ncascade\\nstemming from a single dice placement elsewhere.\\nYou can perform the personal domain action on a given row once per round - since dice aren\\'t stackable there. You can trigger that row anytime on a round too, regardless of it having a dice in there or not. But you cannot trigger it a second time with a single dice placement/within a single turn.\\nHope that helps?\\n\\nI believe so...it\\'s been while since I played this but the next time I do, I\\'ll re-read the rules and your post so I think I should be good now\\nThank you very much.\\n\\n\\n\\nHello everyone!\\nI recently made a tiny expansion for\\nThe White Castle\\n, called\\nOkiku\\'s Dishes\\n.

I really like the idea of your expansion and will try incorporate it the next time I play.\\n\\n\\n\\nNew to this game, so this might be something obvious I\\'m missing, but do the rules forbid phases of my action (specifically, the Lantern bonus phase in this case) from being executed in parts?\\nFor example, say I pick a die that gives me a lantern bonus of a Daimyo Seal and an influence. I take the Seal (but don\\'t take the influence yet), and place my die in a spot that lets me 1) spend that Seal towards a Garden spot and 2) another influence. I then place my Gardener in a spot that gets me 2 additional Seals. Now, with my newfound Seals, I pay for the influence I get with the die spot (my marker\\'s at a checkpoint) and also take the earlier Lantern bonus influence that I didn\\'t take at the time.\\nIt feels like this shouldn\\'t be allowed, but I can\\'t quite find the line in the rulebook that would explicitly forbid it.\\n\\nYou must resolve all your Lantern bonuses (in any order) before taking the action of the die spot you chose.\\nSee\\n\\nYou must resolve all your Lantern bonuses (in any order) before taking the action of the die spot you chose.\\nSee\\n\\nMakes sense! Thank you!\\n\\nDefinitely not allowed, the rulebook doesn\\'t explicitly forbit it, because it doesn\\'t have to. On your turn you do things step by step, and there is a specific order of things.\\nStep 1: Take a die\\nStep 2: Place the die, pay or receive coins\\nStep 3: Take lantern bonus, if left die was taken\\nStep 4: Carry out the actions received for the die placement\\nSo if you are already at Step 4, you can\\'t just go back to Step 3.\\nThis means that\\nA) you absolutely cannot go back to your lantern bonus during step 4 when you acquired a seal for example, that you would need to advance on the influence track.\\nB) you also can\\'t use coins you would get for a placement bonus or the lantern bonus to actually place the die in a spot that you have to pay for. You have to pay for it before you get any bonus on your turn.\\nWhen in doubt always check the order of steps during your turn, and remember that you can\\'t jump between steps.\\n\\nDefinitely not allowed, the rulebook doesn\\'t explicitly forbit it, because it doesn\\'t have to.

The lantern’s action is separate from the die’s action. Otherwise there would be too much chance of conflicting or broken interactions between the two as simultaneous actions.\\n\\nYes, you have to do the action, but I didn’t think you had to do the bonus. E.g. pay to place a Soldier, but do not have to fulfil the bonus action.\\n\\nYes, you have to do the action, but I didn’t think you had to do the bonus. E.g. pay to place a Soldier, but do not have to fulfil the bonus action.\\n\\nCorrect, I read the designer\\'s response on another thread saying you are never forced to take a bonus even if you can afford it.\\nObviously if you can\\'t pay for an action, then you can\\'t take it.\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a really big score in a solitaire game I played last night. I scored over 100 points. I\\'ve only played 10 times, so I figured there are other people that have played a lot more than I have. I was inspired by\\n\\n\\'s session report, so I thought it would be an interesting exercise to replay the same initial setup and see how I did. I also thought that this post could be a walkthrough for the Tokugawa Clan solitaire mode. I think this board is high-scoring for a few reasons, but I hope that other players might try it out and point out ways to score more points so I can get better at the game.\\nI\\'ll update this post with pictures of the starting board positions and give round-by-round narration. I figure this is also a written play-by-play of the Tokugawa Clan automata, so maybe this might be easier to understand and refer to than the rulebook pages or some of the videos. It also can be updated with corrections, in case I\\'m playing wrong.\\nHere is a picture of the main board at the start of the game:\\n\\nI started with the following resources:\\n* 1 iron\\n* 2 mother-of-pearl\\n* 4 mon\\n* 1 daimyo favor token decree card\\nI also started with the samurai action on my player board.\\nSo people can replicate my game, here are pictures of the decks at the start of the game:\\n\\n\\n\\nround 1\\n\\nI rolled the dice:\\n* red 3-4-6\\n* black 3-4-5\\n* white 4-5-5\\nHere is a picture of the solitaire deck for round 1. I took a picture but didn\\'t really look at the cards to avoid affecting my gameplay decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\nround 1 turn 1\\n\\nI took the left red 3 and placed it on right of the first row. I didn\\'t have to pay anything. I took a lantern action, gaining 1 daimyo favor token and 1 iron. I then took the two red die actions: gain 2 mother-of-pearl, and pay 1 favor token to take a samurai action.\\nFor the samurai action, I payed 1 iron to place my first samurai at the 1-iron training ground to take a well action. I gained 1 daimyo favor token, 1 iron, and 1 mother-of-pearl. (You don\\'t get any money for taking a well action this way.)\\nAt the end of my turn, I had\\n1 daimyo favor token, 2 iron, 5 mother of pearl, and 4 mon\\n\\nAI round 1 turn 1\\n\\nI flipped up the first card. There was no middle red die, so I flipped a second card. I placed the middle black die on the left of the 2nd row. Since the die wasn\\'t larger than the printed space, no money was gained.\\nThe first card says to place the AI\\'s first farmer on the unoccupied garden space with the lowest point value. In this case, there were two that were worth 1 point, so I chose bottom stone garden in the lower left. I moved the AI\\'s influence token onto the first space of the heron track. (Note: when I first played the game, I thought you started on the first space, but according to the rulebook, you start on the heron, and only move onto the track after you advance once.) The AI also got 2 clan points.\\nThe second card says to place a farmer on the stone garden with the lowest points, so I placed the AI\\'s second farmer on the middle stone garden (middle left). The AI didn\\'t have a courtier in play, so the AI gets 1 more point (since it\\'s round 1).\\nAI total:\\n3 points, 1st space of heron track\\n\\nround 1 turn 2\\n\\nI took the black 3 and placed it on the bottom row, left. I chose this die for a couple reasons. If the black dice were depleted, the AI\\'s farmer in the middle row wouldn\\'t get extra points (if it were a human player, I\\'d be denying bonus actions from other players). I still wanted to play one more samurai action, but I still had two spaces available for my last turn - the one on my personal board and the one \"outside the gates\" in the lower right of the main board.\\nBecause I played a 3 on a space with a 3, there was no cost.\\nBecause I took a die from the lefthand side of the bridge, I got a lantern action: gaining 1 daimyo favor token and 1 iron. I chose to take the 1 food and 1 mother-of-pearl first. After that, I paid 1 daimyo favor token and 3 iron to send my second samurai to the 3-iron training ground, giving me a courtier action. I paid 2 mon to place courtier at gate, then paid 2 mother-of-pearl to promote him to lefthand side of the bottom row.\\nI took the card off player board, flipped it over, and added it to my lantern actions. I then took the card off the main board and put it on my player board. I chose to take the white scroll action that gave me 1 iron and lantern action. The lantern action gave me 1 iron, 1 daimyo favor token, and moved me up one space on the heron track.\\nAt the end of turn 2:\\n1st space of heron track, 2 daimyo favor tokens, 1 food, 2 iron, 4 mother-of-pearl, 2 mon\\n\\nAI round 1 turn 2\\n\\nThe AI was able to take the white 4 on the left, but the pictured space was blocked by another die. I placed the die at the well and gave the AI 3 mon. The AI played its first courtier at the gate to the castle, moved another space on the heron track, and gained 3 mon.\\nAI total:\\n3 points, 2nd space of heron track, 6 mon\\n\\nround 1 turn 3\\n\\nI took the left white 5 and placed it on courtier/samurai space \"outside the walls\" in lower right. There was no cost.\\nBecause I took the die on the left, I got a lantern reward: 1 daimyo favor token, 1 iron, and one space forward on the influence track.\\nI paid 3 iron to place my third samurai at 3-iron training grounds and gained courtier action. I paid 2 mon to place a courtier at gate, and paid 2 mother-of-pearl to advance to lefthand side of the bottom row.\\nI moved the card from my player board to my lantern area, and then took the card off the main board and put it on my player board. I was granted a second lantern reward: 1 favor token token, iron, 1 space forward - but now I also got 1 mon because of the new card.\\ntotal:\\n3rd space on heron track, 4 favor tokens, 1 food, 1 iron, 2 mother of pearl, 1 mon\\n\\nAI round 1 turn 3\\n\\n<note: wrong picture - will fix after i can see my uploads and put the right one here>\\nThere wasn\\'t a black die on the left, so I had a flip a second card.\\nI placed the right red die on farmer/courtier space outside the walls. The AI gained 1 mon.\\nThe first card said to place the AI\\'s first samurai on the 3-iron training ground, and then promote a courtier. I moved their courtier to left side of the first row, since I didn\\'t want that card.\\nThe second card said to place the second samurai at the 1-iron training ground. I then double-promoted their courtier to the daimyo\\'s chamber. (ARRGH! I wanted that double-lantern spot! The AI always takes the first available spot from left to right.)\\nAI total:\\n3 points, 2nd space on heron track, 7 mon\\n\\nend of round 1\\n\\nAt the end of the round, I was further on the influence track, so I will still go first.\\nThe AI gets points for the two gardeners, since there is still a die each of the associated bridges. (1 point for each gardener because it\\'s round 1, for a total of 2 points.)\\nThe AI paid 5 mon for 1 point (The AI pays 5 mon because they\\'re second on the influence track.

Documenting a game is actually a\\nlot\\nof work, and I think stopping to take photos really broke up the flow of the game, and I think it lead to some rules mistakes. I initially placed a gardener in the wrong spot, and I made a math error in my notes.\\nThe more I\\'m playing this game solo, the more I appreciate the simplicity of the nine-card solo game. It\\'s super simple, and it does its job of blocking spaces and forces you to think about which dice to take (to deny the AI points). When I saw someone playing at the FLGS, they said that they played against the AI 30 times and had never won. This was my eighth solo game. I took notes after each play, especially when I got the solo rules wrong. It\\'s hard because even some of the videos don\\'t show the solo rules correctly.\\nHere\\'s a photo of the high-scoring game:\\n\\nThe dice rolls in round 3 of this game really hurt. I\\'m pretty sure in my high-scoring game, I got a 5-6-6 one round and had a 4-5-5 in another. The triples ones really made the game harder. I also think I had a samurai -> farmer -> courtier combo in my high-scoring game, but I was so busy recording the game this time that I didn\\'t realize that I ran out of samurai before I thought about the combo. I also got two courtiers to the daimyo\\'s chamber the other game, and made it to winter on the heron track. I also got a samurai to the 5-iron training grounds.\\nI got some rules wrong in my last solitaire game, because I didn\\'t give the AI 2 points for each payment after round 2 (instead just giving 1 point), but I don\\'t think it affected the overall play of the game. I am pretty sure that I can break 80 points again, and I think I could with this setup (with better rolls).\\nOverall, I\\'m happy with the solo version included in the box. I kept meaning to print out the Gingkogawa Clan solitaire variant, but I don\\'t think I care about the AI score that much. I like that the overhead is relatively low for the in-the-box solo game, and it still\\nfeels\\nlike I\\'m playing The White Castle. It\\'s an added bonus if I can beat the bot every once in a while.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I\\'m away from home, but I brought The White Castle with me. I was settling in last night, and I decided to get in\\njust one more game\\nof White Castle before bed. I didn\\'t feel like re-doing the setup, so I just shuffled the cards and took new starting cards and started another solitaire game (in-box rules, haven\\'t printed out the Gingkogawa Clan solitaire rules yet.)\\nThis game, I found a good combo where the 3-iron training grounds spot would grant a courtier action. I ended up being able to place a samurai and courtier in the same turn multiple times. I ended up with a lot of iron - I actually went to play a samurai action and realized they were all on the board.\\nI also played most turns using the lantern actions. Looking at the heron track, this was the first time I made it to the 10 pt spot. I even missed a move, because one heron symbol I didn\\'t want to use the 3 favor tokens to advance (since I needed two for a mother of pearl) - but the two lantern actions in the 10-pt space allowed me to get the favor token I needed and another move. I counted the cards I had in my lantern area after, and I think I got more than 15 lantern actions. There were 9 dice, and I think I used 8 of them from the low side. Then, I used some of the lantern cards twice - once when placing a die, and another time when promoting a courtier.\\nThis was the first game where I placed\\nall\\nof my courtiers\\nand\\nsamurai. I hadn\\'t done that before.\\nI\\'m not that good at the game - I\\'ve only played maybe ten times, with most of them being solo games. My average scores are usually in the 60s, while the bot has beaten me with 80 pts or more (and I note I wasn\\'t playing the bot right, either. I wasn\\'t giving it cash for the dice placement. I did make a mistake and give it extra farmers because I misunderstood an automata card, but regardless, I think it\\'s mostly right.)\\nI do, however, take a lot of notes, because I\\'m the de facto rules explainer and need to figure out the best way to explain the game to people.\\nI left the game out last night, and instead of cleaning up, I think I\\'m going to replay the same setup - including not shuffling the cards. But here\\'s the catch - I\\'m going to record it. I\\'ll post the cards and setup in a separate thread in the Sessions forum, including pictures of the startup, and the card order for the decks. I figure that\\'ll be the best way for me to log the results, add pictures, and show my dice rolls. I figure if y\\'all want to use the same setup and dice rolls, you probably can find a better way to score higher. And it would also help to have other sets of eyes to make sure that I\\'m playing the automata right.\\nI 100% agree that this could be a flash in the pan, an after-midnight rules mistake, or any of a whole bunch of possibilities that got me to score that high.\\nI was inspired by\\n\\n33mistletoe33\\n\\n\\'s session report. I\\'m going to start the session thread, with the setup conditions and dice rolls, and card draws. I figure it would be a good exercise for documenting (and maybe creating a new genre of \"hey, play this setup\" for the game - a different kind of solitaire where you play against the other BGGers.)\\nHere\\'s a picture of the final board position so that you can kinda see what happened.\\n\\nConsider me inspired.\\n\\nIt would be nice to have a play by play…\\n\\nIt would be nice to have a play by play…\\n\\nI\\'m working on it. I have pictures of the solitaire play with the same setup that I wanted to do as a \"score attack\" with the same setup, and thought other BGGers might like to try the same initial setup. I started a session thread intending to edit and add photos, but it seems to be waiting for a moderator.\\nThis play I scored short of 80, but I think it was because of a bad roll - triple 1s in the third round. I also didn\\'t have the triple meeple combo that I did in the first time, which robbed me of some points.\\n\\nExciting! Great job! I one managed to place all 15 of my clan members but I lost that game by a few points. Which I thought was ironic. I have an above 50% win rate on solo (17 solo plays) but I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever topped 100. So, that\\'s amazing!\\nAlso, you mentioned trying to figure out how to teach the game. This is what I\\'ve found to be effective: after going through my teach I tell the group that we\\'re going to play through one round and then reset the game and start over. This way they can see how the combos work and how the end of round mechanism with the bridges work. This has been highly effective with experienced and novice gamers. It adds an extra half hour or so but makes it more enjoyable for newer players.\\n\\nSession report is here, but it\\'s still under construction. I have some photos and game descriptions through the start of round 2:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3289145/article/44163469#44...\\nI\\'ll post again when I\\'m finished. I\\'m at a place with slow internet, so I\\'m connecting through my phone, but it\\'s also the same place where I took the pictures, so they\\'re harder to sort through and upload.\\n\\nIt would be nice to have a play by play…\\n\\nI\\'m working on it. I have pictures of the solitaire play with the same setup that I wanted to do as a \"score attack\" with the same setup, and thought other BGGers might like to try the same initial setup.

I also didn\\'t have the triple meeple combo that I did in the first time, which robbed me of some points.\\n\\nI did a play-by-play of the replay of the same initial setup. I only scored in the high 70s - but I think low dice rolls and missing the samurai -> gardener -> courtier combo (and being beaten to the daimyo\\'s room) made a big difference in the score. In the high-scoring game, I had two courtiers in the daimyo\\'s room, and was far enough on the heron track to score 10 points (which is also the furthest I\\'ve ever gotten). In the logged playthrough, I rolled triple ones. I still beat the automata, though.\\nAnyway, the solo playthrough is here:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3289145/try-to-beat-my-soli...\\nIt was a\\nlot\\nof work to get the photos and playthrough logged - I was also trying to document it as a solo playthrough to help people with the solo rules. It was fun to do, but in a programmer and documentation kind of way, and not a \"I\\'m playing a boardgame!\" fun kind of way.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you play the Well action in the castle\\'s card, do you also earn the coins benefit according to the dice used it?\\n\\nYou\\'ll earn a change (or pay a difference) according to the dice you placed in the\\ncastle action space\\n. The fixed 1 value in the Well plays no role here: you resolve the dice value difference before carrying out that space\\'s effect, and the eventual dice value of any chained space has no bearing after that.\\n\\nWhen you play the Well action in the castle\\'s card, do you also earn the coins benefit according to the dice used it?\\n\\nHi!\\nNo you don’t.\\nWhen you trigger the well action is like you triggered it with valued-1 die.\\nThis is clarified in the next reprint\\nAlso, the action that allows you to trigger you Domain action is like you placed a valued-6 die\\nEnjoy the game!\\n\\nThat\\'s not what they\\'re saying. Here\\'s the easiest way to understand it:\\nWherever you put your *actual, physical die* for your turn costs or gains you coins according to the number it\\'s placed on. No other *triggered* action gains or loses you any coins during your turn (unless the *effect* is to gain coins, of course).\\nSo if you *place a die* on your personal board, it costs coins if you place less than a six. But if you *trigger it* from elsewhere in your combo, it doesn\\'t cost anything. Likewise, if you *place a die* on the well, it gains you coins if you placed higher than a 1, but if you trigger it from elsewhere in your combo, it doesn\\'t.\\n\\nGot it. I misunderstood the original question.\\nNow it all makes perfect sense.\\n\\nFor the avoidance of doubt.\\n1) Pick a dice\\n2) Place a dice, resolving the value difference in coins\\n3) Resolve the bonus lantern effect if applicable\\n4) Resolve the dice space effects, including any chained action or effect\\nYou\\'ll always use one and only\\none die\\nper turn, no matter how many actions or effects you chain with a well-thought-out and masterfully carried-out die placement.\\nOnce you\\'ve chosen your die from either the leftmost or rightmost slot of a given bridge, in the act of placing the die in an available space you\\'ll first resolve the\\ncoin difference\\nbetween your dice value and the current value of the space you want to place your dice for the turn.\\nThen you\\'ll resolve the bonus\\nLantern\\neffect if you chose the die from the leftmost slot of the bridge.\\nOnly after you\\'ve resolved the coin difference (and the Lantern bonus if applicable) it is that you\\'ll carry out the\\naction\\nor\\nspace effects\\n- and any chained actions or effects you manage to combo.\\nSo you only get to gain or pay the value difference once, and only in respect to the place you\\'ve actually placed your die.\\n\\nI supposed that would the answer but I wanted to make it clear to a friend. Thanks you all!\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m considering upgrading my set to use metal coins. I\\'ve only played solo or 2p, though, and have no idea how many coins you\\'d need for a 4p game.\\nHave you ever run out of coins during a game? Could I get away with 15 $1 coins? Or do I need to order two sets to have enough?\\n\\nI think you\\'d need at least 16 for a 4-player game because each player could need 4?\\n\\nyeah, i guess that makes sense. i didn\\'t think about doing it from the math point of view.\\n\\nI don\\'t think 16 would be enough.\\nYou need some other denomination, maybe 5x, 5-coin coins.\\n\\nI was going to get a set of 10 koban (the gold oblong coins) - but I didn\\'t have an idea of how many single coins to get. There were 24 included in the box - but that seemed like I didn\\'t need that many.\\n\\nif you play with more than 2p you will definitely need more than 16.  We\\'ve used nearly that many at 2p on occasion.\\nAs suggested above, get some 3 or 5 denomination coins to cut the overall number needed...\\n\\nI don\\'t think 16 would be enough.\\nYou need some other denomination, maybe 5x, 5-coin coins.\\n\\nOh yeah definitely need some 5s as well, I just meant 16 is the minimum number of 1s you\\'d want for a 4 player game\\n\\n\\n\\nI just wrapped up a couple of solo games using the Ginkgogawa clan and was completely walloped. In both games, I had a couple of rounds where the distribution of dice rolls were extremely low (maybe one 4, one 3, and all other dice were 1s or 2s). Immediately, you run out of money and there is basically no way to get any (especially if there are no coins at the well). Very quickly your only option is to repeatedly go to the well. Meanwhile, the bot (could be the base bot or Gingkogawa) is putting 1s down and taking any action it wants.  Clearly in a multiplayer game this would even out, but not in solo. Has anyone else noticed this?\\nI am tempted to house rule something about mandatory re-rolls if the mean of the dice is below more than 1 std dev of the expected sum of the dice.  I\\'m also curious if people have found their scores vs the bots to be higher if the average dice are abnormally high.\\n\\nOr make sure there is always a coin in the well and then use your Lantern actions with the lower dice to get more coins.\\n\\nThe bot will score less with low dice rolls because it will get fewer coins as well.\\nI noticed that going for early stewards (level 1 courtiers) in the first round seems to be the optimal play because it powers your lantern up with coins.\\nOptimal first round against the bot:\\n1 die - combo+courtier lvl 1\\n2 die - combo+courtier lvl 1\\n3 die - gardener+combo (focusing on a bridge with most dices left)\\n\\nThat\\'s true but if there are four 1s left, the bot won\\'t get partial points (i.e. coins) but they will be doing everything else while you are getting almost nothing in return.\\nIt is true that I went for farmers early in both games and that seems to have been a mistake. Putting couriers in the castle seems like a better more, as you suggest.\\n\\nYes, I know what you mean! Some times with a pretty bad setup and bad rolls the automa places a 7 point gardener, a 5 iron warrior and a level 2 courtier.\\nBut that is what makes playing against an automa so cool, its not just beat your own score or points thresholds.\\nTWC automa is  punishing even at the easy level, I also struggled when i started. But now, I`m close to moving on to the medium level.\\n\\n\\n\\nHey!\\nI just finished my 11th game of TWC, a solo game against ginkonawa clan (Bgg automa variant).\\nTo my surprise I managed to place all 15 meeples, and score 95 points.

As you said, is in the appendix explained.\\n*Unless there is an errata, which is not the case.\\n\\nThanks for the replies both.

I am interested in\\n\\nbecause I have heard that it is tight and combo oriented. This reminds me of\\n\\nwhich I love!! \"Only eight cards, see what you can make happen\". I have also been interested in\\n\\nfor years because I like the sound of the interaction of stealing each others dice though I generally don\\'t like overtly mean games. Finally\\n\\nfeels like a bigger euro with dice, and that just sounds awesome to me. So, as you can see, I\\'m all over the place. Help!!\\n\\nOut of the games mentioned ive only played the white castle but highly reccomend it!\\n\\nI\\'ve played all 3. Only played Troyes once years ago and it didn\\'t grab me, but going to give it another go hopefully soon. Grand Austria and White Castle are great. Don\\'t think you can go wrong with either. You can play GAH for free on yucata.de to try it. Both WC and GAH are probably better at 2-3 than 4 player as turn order can loom large in WC with 4 and some complain about downtime in the snaking turn order of GAH.\\n\\n“Stealing each other’s dice” is not how I describe Troyes when I teach it.\\nInstead, consider that no one really owns dice. There are dice on the table that all can use for a price. You pay the person whose district its in — if that’s your own district, then those dice are free.\\nIt’s not about attacking people by stealing their dice; it’s about creating the best moves by figuring out which dice are most valuable to you, even if that means giving an opponent some money. It’s symbiotic.\\nWhite Castle is similar in that the dice also belong to everyone. However, taking a die does not mean you pay another player directly, but it can mean the next die that moves to the end of the bridge, replacing what you took, is now the same or a better die for another player (if it moves to the left) or is now the same slightly worse  (if it moves to the right).\\nTroyes is also a sort of mystery. In the first round, only three of nine cards in play are revealed, and every player has knowledge of one end game goal (the card “in their district” if you will), but its not *only* their goal, it’s everyone’s (similar to the dice) but the other end game goals are unknown as those are in other players’ hands. There’s not much equivalent of this in White Castle.\\n\\nNever played\\n\\n. Just the other two.\\n\\nis prob my fave game of all time.\\nIn a two player game I find I can do pretty much anything I want. I find it much more interesting as a three or four player game. Four the board seems almost crowded. But that may just be because I\\'ve played the most at two amd three. The expansion gives more room to move in this regard with aditional mini boards.\\nTroyes also has a little bit of math as you count pips on one to three dice sets you use and divide a number from an activity card into it to determine how many times you get to do that activity - if you\\'ve paid the money to place a meeple. Only sometimes might you deal with combos if an activity card comes out allowing you to place a cube for increasing the value of future dice.\\n\\nis all about obtaining combos. Dice are placed simply for choosing which action to do, or preferable to start a series of actions with. Combos. Made me think of some older ccg that allowed you to play a bunch of cards in a row. Combos. Maximizing combos.\\n\\nThanks for all the thoughts. In my continued research I noticed that you can also play Troyes on BGA. I am not a huge fan of these digital adaptions of games but they are certainly worth a shot. Another of my consideration in all this are the expansions. I have noticed that many people really like the \\'Ladies\\' expansion for Troyes, and also people like the expansion \\'Let\\'s Waltz\\' expansion for GAH. Since it would be nice to get a functional game without further expense, this is a definite plus for The White Castle. Curious how essential these expansions are?\\n\\nThanks for all the thoughts.

Since it would be nice to get a functional game without further expense, this is a definite plus for The White Castle. Curious how essential these expansions are?\\n\\nTroyes functions quite well without the expansion.\\nI\\'ve only played with it a few times so far because....other games.\\nBut it adds five modules total. Any one could be added by itself to base.\\n-three new end game secret bonus cards.\\n-a purple die for each player no one can buy from your district.\\n-6 additonal event cards. These types of cards everyone must at times combat.\\n-27 new activity cards. Base game has 27 activity cards. Only nine randomly are in any given game. So a bunch more variety.\\n-outdoor activity mini boards that give more options to do.\\nTroyes expansion is in no way \"a fix\" expansion. Except maybe the purple die for people who don\\'t like dice in their district getting used by other players.\\n\\nI own and have played all three of those games in question a few times, even though Troyes and GAH without the expansion (I own the expansion for GAH).\\nFirst of all: I think all three are really great games, and you can\\'t go wrong with any of them. I also have to second Bob742 in regard to that the expansions for Troyes and GAH are not necessary at all. Both are great without those.\\nCompared to White Castle, Troyes and GAH are bigger games, which I think is an important deciding factor. Me personally prefers them over White Castle, but that\\'s just preference. Also the other feel more different in each playthrough because Troyes has changing \"powers\" in each playthrough and GAH is dominated by the employees you can get and what you can make of those. White Castle feels more predetermined to me as the rooms are just slight variations of the basic actions.\\nAlso, Troyes has a bit of cooperation when everyone has to work on defeating the crisis, although thats rather minimal and also more about the personal bonus you get out of them. To me, Troyes never really felt mean at all, it\\'s not different from for example some else blocking your worker placement spot in other games.\\nMy personal ranking right now would probably be:\\nGAH -> Troyes -> White Castle\\nGood luck with your decision, I\\'m sure you won\\'t regret getting any of those games.\\n\\nGAH is one of Shei and me all-time favorite. Troyes is one of our keepers. And White Castle, well, I\\'m biased\\nAs someone said, GAH and Troyes are \"bigger\" games in terms of length, box, complexity (kinda, they\\'re not so different than White Castle) and price. So if you tend to like more bigger games, to me GAH is the winner. But if you don\\'t care, White Castle will be a good option.\\nRegarding expansions, I had Ladies of Troyes and own Let\\'s Waltz. You have tons of fun without them, so don\\'t worry if you don\\'t have them in the first place. But if you are a completist (like me) you will like them\\n\\nI don\\'t make top xyz lists but if I had a top 10 list, all 3 would be in it.  They\\'re very different games though, and perhaps the only commonality is the dice.\\nThe White Castle is very tight, only 9 turns, so you have to maximize every turn to create combos and do things.  And when you can execute a great combo it\\'s incredibly satisfying.  Some people find the tightness a little frustrating, but I like that it really pushes you to think.  And it also means that you can get a good, crunchy game in around an hour.\\nTroyes is more about balance and it\\'s a bit of an unforgiving game (in a fun way).  You want to stay relevant in various parts of the board because if you don\\'t, it will bite you.  The dice \"stealing\" isn\\'t really mean, it\\'s strategic, and like Jon says, nobody owns them, people own the districts.  The one thing that can be a little tough about Troyes is getting the rules down at first, but once you do, it\\'s a blast.  Of the 3 I find Troyes the least visually appealing but the mechanics make it a classic.\\nGAH is just lovely in all ways.  Thematically it\\'s excellent, the design is unique, and I love the art.  There\\'s very little player interaction, if any, and it is the one that involves the most luck of the 3.  It\\'s shared luck and it\\'s not a lot of randomness but once in a while you can\\'t get the dice you really need or the guests available don\\'t suit your setup.  But it\\'s pretty exciting (and I know that sounds a bit funny with Euro games) when you can get the right dice to fill sections of your hotel to get bonuses using guests that give you lots of good stuff.\\nMy recommedation would be to get all 3.  You won\\'t be sorry.\\n\\nI don\\'t think you mention your usual or frequent player counts. I suspect 3, since two of the games are rated as best with 3. GAH is rated as best with 2, recommended with 3, but not with 4.\\nI can recommend TWC with any number from 1-4, although I agree that 3 is best.\\n\\nRepeating some other’s thoughts, the Ladies of Troyes is not necessary at all, but a nice expansion and modular; one can use some elements or all of them. It’s fine to get the base game and not think about the expansion for a bit.\\nOf the three games mentioned, White Castle I think of in a slightly different category than the other two, given how quickly it plays. So having both Troyes and White Castle does not feel redundant at all. White Castle would compete with other games I have that play under an hour like Finca, Vikings, and the Hanging Gardens, all of which have wildly different mechanics but play in a similar time and work well for two players so a nice fit for when my wife and I want something together.\\nTroyes and GAH also play well with two players, but they take a bit longer. It’s more like sitting down for a movie rather than a television show. I personally found GAH to take a bit too long, especially with more than two people, and it is no longer in my collection, but I’d be happy to play it if someone else had it and presented it as an option.\\nFor other games with dice:\\n\\nis one of my wife’s favorite games. I enjoy it but I feel our games go very similar at two players and prefer it with three or four. My wife’s love of CoB has led me to explore other games with dice mechanics and tableau building.\\n\\nwhich I enjoyed but my family disliked; happily, a local friend likes it so now he owns it and I can still play it from time to time.\\n\\nis an interesting design and has a good solo mode. My wife isn’t convinced by it so it may not stay but I find it clever.\\n\\n(and the other South Tigris games) do clever things with dice but this game takes a ton of space, and can be a bit too much multiplayer solitaire for some people,\\n\\nI don\\'t think you mention your usual or frequent player counts. I suspect 3, since two of the games are rated as best with 3. GAH is rated as best with 2, recommended with 3, but not with 4.\\nI can recommend TWC with any number from 1-4, although I agree that 3 is best.\\n\\nGood question, yes usually 3 but occasionally 2 or 4. But this isn\\'t my primary concern cuz I have many other games for the various player counts\\n\\nThe more I play The White Castle, the more I\\'m enjoying it. I keep looking for (constructive) negative comments on BGG to challenge my opinion and, so far, none of the negative views have swayed my opinion of the game. I will note that it took probably three plays before the game \"clicked\" for me but, once it did, I\\'ve enjoyed every play even more. It\\'s definitely rising up the ranks into my favorite games and will likely end up in my top ten.\\nI\\'ve also played GAH and it\\'s GREAT but, as discussed, a longer game. I haven\\'t played Troyes so can\\'t comment on it.\\nI also love Res Arcana and, one of the things I enjoy about it is the tightness of decisions to play efficiently.

I see discussion on that point. I like your comment because it\\'s true that you must play games more to find out if it\\'s great or sometimes even broken! So do you recommend it as a 2 player game?\\n\\nI’ve only played it 2 player once so far and it was my 2nd play so I was still learning the game. It was different than 3 player because you’re stuck dealing with spaces getting blocked out immediately and you may need to pivot your plans. However, I still enjoyed it immensely and I also like the occasional pivot in gaming. Also, I lost that game but still enjoyed the play.\\n\\nIs White Castle also good at 2 players? I see discussion on that point. I like your comment because it\\'s true that you must play games more to find out if it\\'s great or sometimes even broken! So do you recommend it as a 2 player game?\\n\\nI saw this game originally reviewed by The Brothers Murph who have presumably played it 2P a bunch and they love it. They also have a playthrough video of them playing it 2P linked\\nhere\\n\\nWe\\'ve played the older two, Troyes and GAH and they\\'re both rated \"10\" without expansions.  I, too, recently purchased White Castle and I\\'m looking forward to our first play.  Grand Austria is best at two only because of the amount of thinking involved.  It works fine for more but you\\'ve got to be prepared for some downtime.  Troyes may be best at three, but I only get to play at two where it\\'s just fine and the \"stealing\" dice is funny but not \"mean\" at all.

It would always seem a bit foolish to go against the tide especially when your opponents will exploit them.\\nThe expansion did a fair attempt in fixing the issue, which we applaud, and hence we play the game every time with the expansion.\\nJust adding two cents regarding this aspects…\\n\\nI only own GAH and I reply seeing a lot of interesting comments saying the expansions not a must.\\nBut from our experience the experience is almost a must because the base game suffer from a basic problem that basically you will always be forced to take the action with highest power (ie has most dice) as honestly all the actions are almost equally good unless you are in end game you are desperate to finish off a little something.

Emailed replacements@devir.com about the issue with my new copy of White Castle, got reply and it’s been close to 2 weeks.\\nAre you able to provide some help?\\nThank you!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first time I played this game by the 3 rounds rule I was left feeling indifferent about the game. I liked most of the game but at the end of the third I didn’t feel like I had accomplished anything. The engine was just getting going. I was sure I was right so decided to play again but this time go 4 rounds. After the fourth round we decided we were having fun so went one more round. That was it, we all agreed that this was the perfect amount of rounds. We still had 3 to 4 meeples left on our boards, and our passage of time gave us 3 victory points.\\nI think that when you design a game and print it with a limited amount of rounds on the board you limit the buyers and players. In this game by printing it with only 3 rounds is not going to appeal to those who are not interested in just playing  quicker games. If the designers would have printed with 5 rounds and simply stated the following:\\n“For a quicker game play 3 rounds, for a normal game play 4 rounds, and for an epic game play 5 rounds.”\\nThis game would appeal to everyone without having to house rule anything. This game gets a 6.7 - 7 the way it is printed, but with the additional 2 rounds it is easily an 8 - 8.5.\\n\\nAfter the fourth round we decided we were having fun so went one more round. That was it, we all agreed that this was the perfect amount of rounds. We still had 3 to 4 meeples left on our boards, and our passage of time gave us 3 victory points.\\n\\nIt\\'s really just a matter of learning the game. Your 5 rounds are about what I do in the normal 3 rounds (though I\\'m sometimes higher on the Passage of Time track). Finding ways of placing 2-3 workers in one turn makes a big difference (and takes some building up).\\n\\nPersonal taste, but I enjoy the tightness of the 9 rounds and think it is the perfect length. It leaves you wanting more each time you play it, especially with the variable setup. There is a reason it was designed the way that it was. I wouldn\\'t change a thing, but understand how some people might not want to play a game like that.\\n\\nIt\\'s a bit like Lost Ruins of Arnak. First games, you can\\'t do that much and feel it ended too quickly. But as you get better, the last two rounds already become quite epic and you achieve much more. Same with The White Castle. It\\'s a question of experience before you start doing a lot in merely 3 rounds.\\nWith all due respect, this could be posted in \"General\", it\\'s not really a review. I like it as \"first impressions\", but a little more meat is expected for reviews.\\n\\nYeah we just played this weekend and a new player only had 3 workers left on their board in 3 rounds. Sometimes you get the right engine / cards / setup.\\n\\nGlad to see you enjoy the game! If you scan through the past posts, you can see many new players suggest to add the 4th round and you are the first one to suggest the 5th as well.\\nYou can achieve the epic result with 3 rounds. In a usual game we place 12–13 meeples and score up to 3rd section of passage of time. That\\'s what most of the game fans enjoy: tight gameplay, scarce resources, only 9 turns, and combo moves that let you place 2-3 meeples in a single turn.\\nSo feel free to homerule the game the way you enjoy it and also consider using base rules and find how to get 80pts out of 9 turns! It is doable. Thank you for sharing your experience.\\n\\nYes thats the natural feeling but remeber its a simple yet deep eurogame and not many people has time to play 2 hours of game. This game its an step to more complex eurogames!\\nI guess the magic of the game relies on that; short time to have deep strategy with a simple game.\\n\\nFor what it\\'s worth, the upcoming expansion adds an action for each player per round.\\n\\n\\n\\nCould someone please post the approximate measurements of the main and player boards? Asking because I currently live in a university dorm, which has a small table. Just want to know if the main + player board will fit on it. I have seen them in videos and it seems like they\\'ll fit but just want to be sure. It\\'s for solo play so not worried about more than one player board.\\n\\nGame board: 35,5cmx66,5cm\\nPlayer board: 14cmx21cm\\nI have a copy from 999 games.\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\n\\n\\nHi All,\\nI hope you will not burn me alive but I played the gam few times and my final game was to get the max out of every single action. We played 2 players and it was kind of \"cooperation\" to always calculate the best possible move and score. I totally understand that moves we did not take, could have made a difference, however the game ended 52 vs 36 and this was with both players trying their best. We have not competed and tried to get max resources, points, etc. just to see the results.\\nThe reason behind this issue is simple: the board\\'s set up sometimes (often?) promote e.g. first player and in an unfortunate event, changing that first player may be very difficult (too expensive, too time / moves consuming) or simply impossible. When u are 2nd, 3rd or 4th and there\\'s lots of 1 on dices, then end of a round is very \"poor\" in options.\\nI will give it a go, twice may be three times but I have \"I have a bad feeling about this\"\\nAll the best and enjoy your games!\\nKind Regards,\\nErboka\\nps. How do you score 15 points with a Heron action?\\n\\nThe reason behind this issue is simple: the board\\'s set up sometimes (often?) promote e.g. first player and in an unfortunate event, changing that first player may be very difficult (too expensive, too time / moves consuming) or simply impossible.

I\\'ve not played a ton of games but I\\'ve never felt that, even as second player I had \"poor options\". Like, there\\'s so many things you can do...\\nAlso find it funny that the last \"this game is broken\" thread bemoaned that lantern strategy is OP, but you\\'re saying that having to take low dice makes the game unwinnable. Which is it?\\nI really wish people would play more than one or two games before declaring that a game which has been playtested hundreds of times prior to publication is \"broken\\'\\n\\nDo you honestly think in most games every player has an equal scoring opportunity, regardless of the initial setup?  Or does it just bother you that it\\'s easier to actually math it out in this game and see it\\'s not the case?\\n\\nMost important is that my final game was kind of solo but with two players and we were make sure we always pick best options. This is very important to remember as it should show we have not played against each other and we were discussing next rounds moves.\\nThe simplest, a bit exaggerated, is that e.g. 4th player may be forced to use Well action as won\\'t be able to afford an action (if all dice are 1s and players 1-3 used higher dice). Starting gold may be not enough to jump on a 5-6 dice with a 1 value.\\nI am not sure how else to elaborate, think of this as \"AI playing the game\"\\nWe tried to score max with two players and player two lost. This suggest, the 2nd player had no chances of winning.\\n\\nBut the maximum points return on an action can\\'t be known at the time you take the action because the game state evolves? Saying \"we tried to score max with two players\" is literally just saying \"we played a two-player game\". Like, what do you think players normally do when they play, if not maximizing this score?\\n\\nThat the actual point of a \"balanced game\". If you can \"see\" you have no chances of winning from the actual game set up, than why bother? Similar-ish game e.g. Castles of Burgundy gives more opportunities to players and loosing \"a good spot\" in round 1, means you just need to figure it out. In the White Castle, this could be really The End.\\nI would like to repeat what I said above: we have calculated all available and legal moves (without take actions back) it player 2 was doom from round 1. After the game, we even tried to take \"virtual moves\" to see if taking different action would score points. We managed to find 5-8 max, but the player 1 did not have to think much and it was way easier.\\nPerhaps it was bad luck with the dice, don\\'t know.\\n\\nSorry for not making it clear: we have played 2 players game playing one Clan. Two people played Clan A and the same 2 player played Clan B.\\n\\nFWIW, if you feel you need to be first player it\\'s not that hard to score a few herons and move up the track for next turn.\\n\\nAlso find it funny that the last \"this game is broken\" thread bemoaned that lantern strategy is OP, but you\\'re saying that having to take low dice makes the game unwinnable. Which is it?\\nI really wish people would play more than one or two games before declaring that a game which has been playtested hundreds of times prior to publication is \"broken\\'\\n\\nSeems like people are just trolling these boards now. Obviously the broken strategy is maxing out the heron track on the first turn. /s\\n\\nThank you for adding extra to you post after me answering\\nI played the game 4-5 times, I logged it on BGG I think 3 times as usually \"learning the rules\" plays are just learning and not playing. If a game forces me to play 10 or 20 times before I know \"how to\", that means the game\\'s design is not for me. I don\\'t have time to learn the rules and then learn how to play, learn strategies, and learn how to get out of a \"shithole\".\\nLantern strategy can sometimes be very OP. When a game allows you to make only 9 moves, then no move or strategy should give \"superpowers\". This game is \"so small\", that it is easy to see how many points you and all other players have . Knowing I have 30 points with a chance for additional e.g. 10-15 points, and I see you already have 40, then continuing the game is a bit pointless.\\n\\nIn my yesterday\\'s play, my friend who was the 3rd player, could not afford to do it and then later in the game it was \"too late\". Player 1 just flown away, I was in the middle but still too far to reach. This was our 1st or 2nd play, so a wee possibility of incorrect rules applies\\n\\nI think you have missed my point that you cannot possibly know when taking a move if it is the \"best possible move\" because who\\'s to say that taking food now to play a gardener earlier is not better than taking pearl to play courtiers? You simply can\\'t know the \"best possible\" move in a game without perfect information. Or you understand that perfectly well and are trolling. I dunno and don\\'t really care at this point. But your \"method\" for trying to determine first player advantage is frankly insane and if you really wanted to try and achieve such a demonstration, do what you describe here (leaving aside the fact that you are simply assuming that you are \\'maximizing\" the score for both players without possibly being able to know if that is really the case) 1000 times over. Then you\\'re findings may actually be worth a BGG post.\\n\\nIt is middle of night in my timezone, so I may have misunderstood\\nI have not tired to say that 1st player always win, I have said that 2nd player in my game had zero chances of winning from the 1st to the last move. We have tried to pick always \"the best at the time\" move to maximise points and/or resources for next rounds. The White Castle suffers from \"critical error\", similarly to Chess. If you have two very good players (or one player is new and 2nd is way more experienced), then a small mistake (or not knowing the right moves due to lack of experience) makes that game \"pointless\". And in a game of Chess, you have more than 9 moves\\nI will play the game few more times this week, may be I change mind. I hope.\\n\\nYou say that you both did as good as you possibly could have done in the game. While each game state is different, I have scored higher than both of you in 2 games and won, and lost. You cannot know what courier cards will come out, nor what the dice will come out. I would be very impressed if you map out all your turns at the beginning of the game. And even if you can, that does not account for the second player seeing what you have planned and taking the move you wanted, or taking the castle card that had the light colored action that you were counting on.\\n\\nps. How do you score 15 points with a Heron action?\\n\\nIt happens. Setup dependent. We went from scoring in the 30s to consistently break the 60s mark.\\nUnfortunately I didn\\'t always log who was the 1st player in all my plays but for now the last player has won just as many times as any particular player in the starting order - as in, has won just the same as the 1st and 2nd players.\\nWe\\'ve played it in 4p only once. Most of our games are 2p.\\nIt quickly became one of our favorites games\\n\\nWow. Your headline is obviously false in its conclusion (and mine-bogglingly arrogant). You admit you haven’t played the game much, and may well be playing it incorrectly, yet you nevertheless believe you have a sound rational basis for trashing it?\\nThousands of people have played and enjoyed this game (many finding it to be the top new board game release of 2023) without reaching your meritless conclusion. Just jaw-dropping.\\nTry at least phrasing the headline in the form of a question.\\n\\nHow did you manage to score 4 points with the \"Passage of Time\" as you can only do 3, 6, 10-15 and how did you make 32 on the \"Training Yards\"? Do you remember your meeple set up?\\n\\n22 from castle and 32 from training yards could be:\\nCastle: 2 * 3 pts + 1 * 6 pts + 1 * 10 pts\\nTraining yards: 4 samurai in 5 iron space give 4 samurai * 4 courtiers * 2.\\n4 pts from passage of time is a mystery\\n\\n22 from castle and 32 from training yards could be:\\nCastle: 2 * 3 pts + 1 * 6 pts + 1 * 10 pts\\nTraining yards: 4 samurai in 5 iron space give 4 samurai * 4 courtiers * 2.\\n4 pts from passage of time is a mystery\\n\\nYep\\nThe Passage of Time was a simple typo when noting down the score:\\n\\nMy SO will be... Thrilled with the rectification of the result\\n\\nYeah, I did the math and 22 points from the castle and 32 from the yards require 4 meeples in the castle and 4 at (5 iron) spot (total of 20 iron!): 8 * 4 or 3 at 5 iron + 1 + 1 (3 iron or 1 iron in any combination). This would require 17 iron as minimum. Sending 4 meeples to the castle and 4 or 5 to the training yards with only 9 dice? It would have to be a perfect game and in my sceptical opinion possible only on paper. We need to remember coins and other resources are also needed.\\n\\nYou have managed to collect 21 iron and 20 Heron moves? Please record a video as I would love to observe that game!\\n\\nNo offense, but at this point you are better off employing yourself to playing this game better\\nThere are plenty of threads on \"average scores\" or \"what\\'s a good score\". Once the game clicks, seems to me the\\nbaseline\\nshould be in the 50s or 60s. As in, anything below that and it\\'s a \"yeah, I messed up badly in this one\". We\\'ve seeing plenty of reports of people scoring in the 90s somewhat consistently when they play it well too.\\nThe scoring definitely takes significant steps once you get familiar with the mechanics and the strategy horizon so to speak unveils itself.\\nMind you, you are not \"forced\" to \"play 10 or 20 times\". It is a hobby and something we do for fun; if you\\'re not gelling with a game there\\'s absolutely no reason to keep it - no matter what the BGG rankings or community says.\\nBut this attitude of calling a game\\nbroken\\nwith just a few plays under your belt while having a hard time wrapping your mind around what are relatively common scores is bound to ruffle some feathers.\\n\\nI have not said the game is broken but somehow broken. I have clearly explained the \"broken\" element was my unique situation for a 2nd player could not win, also I see you do not have many more plays than I do and you have games where the difference in points is 21, 16, 30 (between 1st and 2nd player only). Does it look \"normal\" to have nearly twice the points than your opponents?\\n\\nNone of my plays have the winner with a difference of \"nearly twice\" the points of the 2nd place, not even accounting for the plays logged by my friends. But I wouldn\\'t find it odd if it happened when we have a new player on the table of if one of us have a specially bad game.\\nTo the point here: your \"somehow broken\" impression of the game seems to stem from your still progressing level of skill and grasp of the game (reading the table and chaining actions), not any intrinsic element of The White Castle. And it is okay for you to feel that way. Even if you could present an intriguing case as to how a 2p game is broken, fortunately that is not what we\\'re experiencing in our table.\\nI honestly can\\'t say if you\\'re still interested in clicking with TWC or just want to level criticism.\\nI\\'d be glad to chime in with my 2c if the former.\\nIf the latter, I wasn\\'t being facetious when I said you\\'re not obliged to insist with a game you don\\'t particularly like. I love having my takes and opinions and can\\'t really fathom when people gang up to say that what one\\nfeels\\nis wrong. To each their own, and I find it senseless to make a beef out of people house ruling their own games or deciding to fill their free time playing a reskin of Zombicide in lieu of the hypothetical instant classic overhyped Spiel des Jahres of the moment.\\nHeh, reread this comment twice here on my phone trying to make it more friendly, but I\\'m in a rush. Sorry if it sounds harsh or rough, that is not what I intended. In a nutshell, you don\\'t need to justify not liking TWC that much or even be open to revisit your initial impressions, and your take as to it being \"somehow broken\" at 2p does not match our own experience.\\n\\nSending 4 meeples to the castle and 4 or 5 to the training yards with only 9 dice? It would have to be a perfect game and in my sceptical opinion possible only on paper.\\n\\nI don\\'t see anything perfect about this game, actually. A skilled TWC enjoyer sends an avg of 12 out of 15 meeples in a typical game and up to 2 or even 3 meeples in a single turn. I\\'m more surprised by 1) 15 pts on passage of time 2) only one Gardner.\\nSo maybe the answer is: if you generally like the game, you can try to dive deeper, search for the combo chains, and believe that a decently playtested game from experienced designers is probably not broken. It might be tricky or specific setup might be greedy (what can actually be fixed with more \"promote courtier\" actions). But it only makes a puzzle more interesting to solve.\\nAnd thank you for sharing your thoughts and asking questions. I\\'m glad to see that we are in a welcoming community that is open to discussion. I can\\'t wait to see TWC playable online on BGA to be able to compete with fans from all over the globe.\\n\\n\\n\\nHi,\\nJust got the game, just cracked the shrink and started reading the rules and already realising the reboxing will be tight.\\nAre the bridges just a table presence \"gimmick\" and could have been just printed on the board?\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, they look neat and all, but (like the tree in Everdell) are they more \"because we can\" than \"because we need to\"?\\n\\nhuh\\n\\nI\\'ve not even assembled them because it honestly seems slightly pointless and I\\'m not sure how they\\'d fit back in the box when its already so tight. They are pretty cute though!\\n\\nI think the nature of what each section of the bridges represents makes it much easier to read with the 3D components. It probably could\\'ve been printed on the board, but that\\'d have been harder to read and maybe prone to slight mistakes with understanding where a die is.\\nIf we\\'re gonna compare to the Everdell Tree, then no, it\\'s nothing like that.\\n\\nThe 3-D bridges work very well and are thematic and quite attractive, but, yes, theoretically they could have been replaced with flat bridges (that ideally had 3-D slots for the nine dice, to avoid slippage). And of course no one is forced to use them.\\nBut my wife and I think they are great and make the game “pop” in the table…\\n\\nThe rules even say you can play without the 3D bridges, so it\\'s not a big deal (just played yesterday 3-player without them and it was fine).

The graphic design resembles that of the Automa cards. One could just as easily play without the assembled bridges - easily as in, just go. Everything is there.\\nSliding dice to take the edge positions is something we often forget to do. I\\'ve played TWC with 5 different people already and it is a common \"oopsie\". The bridges being 3D have value in that they make correcting that mistake or avoiding it altogether much easier, in my opinion. It\\'s a good\\nvisual cue\\n.\\nThat said, reboxing the game can be tiring. I got a 3D insert for it to ease things up and even so it is not exactly a breeze, but it\\'s much better now. This one and Gloomhaven Jaws of The Lion are probably the only games in my collection that I have notes and reference pics to remind me of how to pack them properly.\\n(Miss you, Darryl\\n)\\n\\nThanks all.\\nI have now \"caught up\" a bit with the rules and so a lot of the points made here make sense.\\nI might investigate making dual-layer bridges out of token board, with recesses to retain the dice, but we will be playing it for the first time in the week so we will see how we get on.\\n\\nAs said above, you can easily play without them.\\nI have them assembled and everything stores in the box just fine {minus the superfluous copies of the rules).

No problems reboxing.\\nAs others have said, the 3D bridges are not needed, but they are a great visual reminder.\\n\\nWe sometimes find that the 3D bridges make it harder for some players to see the gardener cards and make the game just a bit more fiddly. (The dice can be a bit more difficult to grab in the bridges.) So we usually play without them, even though they do add a nice visual appeal to the game.\\nAnd if you\\'re looking for an insert option, I might humbly recommend my insert, in which I combined some of the best ideas I found from other insert designs.\\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6372174\\n\\nWe sometimes find that the 3D bridges make it harder for some players to see the gardener cards and make the game just a bit more fiddly.

Thanks!!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe photo shows the backs of most of the cards in the box. It doesn’t show the Garden cards (Plant and Stone). Nor does it show the Yard tiles.\\nThe cards that seem to cause the most uncertainty are the ones with the lightest backs: the Decree cards. They are the only cards not shown in the Setup instructions (pages 2 and 3 of the rulebook). You can play without them if you want; I’ll get to that toward the end of this post.\\n\\nThe three stacks of cards on the left are the ones that go in the castle itself. At the bottom left are the Steward cards, with the ochre backs, which go on the lowest level of the castle.\\nEvery Steward card has a coin on the back. When you take a Steward card during the Courier action, it adds a coin to your Lantern.\\nThe Diplomat cards are above the Steward cards, in the photo as in the castle. On the (indigo) backs of every Diplomat card is a heron, which gets added to your Lantern when you take the cards.\\nThe Daimyo cards are above the Diplomat cards. You never take the Daimyo card from the board during a game.\\nOn the right of the photo are the cards used during Player Setup: from to to bottom, Starting Resource cards (orange back), Starting Action cards (yellow back) and Decree cards (lightest back). Each player gets a pair of starting cards: one Resource card, one Action card.\\nYou can set up the game without the Decree cards. I suspect that the designers (or others involved in the game) considered including in the “For your first play” box on page 2 instructions for leaving out the Decree cards. To leave them out, take out, not only the Decree cards, but each Starting Resource card showing a Decree card. One of the three Resource cards with Food on the back shows the Fan Decree card. One of the cards with Pearl on the back shows the Coin Decree card. One of the cards with Iron on the back shows the Seal Decree card. If you take out the Starting Resource cards showing a Decree card, you will still have six Starting Resource cards to pair with the six Starting Action cards.\\nI would take out the Decree cards, and the three Starting Resource cards that show them, if I was teaching TWC to non-gamers. But I wouldn’t teach this game to non-gamers, unless they had a particular interest in the Himeji castle. Here’s a photo featuring both the game box and the castle itself: credit to BGGer tkoyama.\\n\\nYour post seems to me missing the central rationale for why you seem to find decree cards problematic. Aside from a (in my opinion) misleading bit of conjecture at the start (\"The cards that seem to cause the most uncertainty are the ones with the lightest backs: the Decree cards\"), I\\'m not following the\\nwhy\\nin this equation.\\nYes, I did find them confusing at the start. However, this had little to do with them being complex or hard to understand, and more due to the rulebook kind of sidestepping any reference to them (I call your statement misleading because the implication, to me, was that the cards caused uncertainty due to their nature vs. the rulebook ignoring them -- admittedly you do address that in the following sentence, but not in a way that makes a causal link between the statements).\\n\\nThe Starting Resource that get you the Decree Cards have fewer resources to balance that out.\\nI see no reason whatsoever to leave out the Decree cards.\\n\\nI did consider stating the reasons why I think the decree cards add uncertainty, but thought the post was long enough already. I think that they cause uncertainty because:\\n1. they seem to be asked about here out of proportion to their role in the game.\\n2. they add another dimension to the choice of starting cards.\\nI know (and point out when teaching) that a decree card comes at a price in the form of fewer starting resources.\\nI would consider leaving them out if teaching the game to non-gamers. I don\\'t think that TWC is a good game to teach to most non-gamers. I would teach it to non-gamers who thought it looked particularly cool, which they might do it they were interested in the castle itself.\\n\\nWhat I found confusing was the term lightest colored back.\\nTo me that is the cards on the bottom left of the image. I would have called them light blue, or said right away the 3 cards on the bottom right row.\\nI agree that the rulebook not showing which card is which and what it is used for (especially the decree cards Is a problem). In fact I think the cards are completely fine for new players, I would say they are most confusing for the owner of the game the first time they are teaching, but if the only way to remedy that is to read on bgg.\\n\\nI did consider stating the reasons why I think the decree cards add uncertainty, but thought the post was long enough already.

Like many, I read the rules before sorting and poking the components, so it took me a second to look to the resource cards that granted them as an explanation for their existence. In some ways you can say they printed that portion of the rules on the components, themselves.\\nUpon realizing they were a reward for a start-of-game selection, the rest was easy. I wouldn\\'t even say I find them harder to appreciate than any other component, and certainly less confusing than the silhouette discrepancy that trips people up (the silhouettes in the garden are used differently than in the castle, making some feel only a single meeple of any color can be on any garden space - wasn\\'t a personal issue, but I\\'ve seen others cite it).\\nI do agree that this isn\\'t a game for non-gamers; to find enjoyment in the White Castle you have to enjoy the puzzle of finding the most efficient use of one\\'s energy at any one moment. I had never thought to it in these terms (i.e. not new gamer friendly), but upon reading your take above I found myself nodding in agreement. I\\'m not even sure an interest in Hajime Castle would overcome this, imho.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are three cards with a creamy background. They have a coin on one, a fan on another and a flower on the third. They are each printed the same, back and front.\\nWhat is their purpose in the game?\\n\\nSome of the starting resource cards you can draft will add one of those cards to your lantern to start.\\n\\n\\n\\nI love The White Castle for its depiction of Himeji Castle life from hundreds of years ago.

I started with a lantern card in initial setup and then focused on getting lantern cards by moving up the castle, and then always taking the lower die and trying to activate the lantern another time during an action. Once I started this there was no incentive for me to ever take a higher die. Using this strategy I scored around 97 pts but notably lapped all the other players. I\\'m wondering if this was an anomaly due to the cards which happened to be present or a dominant strategy.\\nIt might seem that this would not work unless one always had coins but I actually had no issue with coins and ended up with a substantial surplus. I did have a coin in my lantern. I also started with a daimyo seal in the lantern and accumulated so many seals that I had to trade a few for coins when I didn\\'t need to just to make space. So perhaps this was luck due to the composition of the lantern?\\nI also had passage of time and 1 VP and later 2 VP in the lantern - got both early on. Managed to get passage of time near the top (again seals were also in the lantern and never had a problem with necessary seals) and easily was first player by a wide margin. Due to the VP in the lantern I was also far ahead on the VP track prior to final scoring.\\nRegardless of the composition of my lantern, it seems that building the lantern is an obvious choice as it is so much stronger than taking the higher die once you get started and can manage to get the coins. Perhaps to win by a wide margin the cards have to come out right but regardless it still seems very strong. The other players could not really stop a player doing this, just imitate, but if one doesn\\'t start doing this early it obviously isn\\'t as powerful.\\nSo am I missing something or is a lantern strategy like I described a dominant strategy?\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of conditions to that working in addition to the fact you played with all new players which could speak to their scores being low enough for you to lap them. I think it\\'s very possible for the lantern to become very powerful under the right conditions, but I\\'m doubtful it\\'s going to be a dominant strategy across multiple games - due to the randomness of the game setup, the castle cards, the die rolls, etc.\\nI\\'d be interested to see if you can do this in multiple games, though. Your sample size right now is 1.\\n\\nI\\'d be interested to see if you can do this in multiple games, though.

As you said, having a coin and a seal in yours was key.\\nIt\\'s funny how strategies differ.

Take a picture of the initial setup, note what people do, take another picture when the cards change, and you’ll have a documented accounting, and if there are any rules problems, they’d be far easier to spot than speculation.\\nOr that game is simply broken, I guess. I suppose the people I play, as well as myself, with are particular bad at this game, and haven’t stumbled upon the broken strategy you found in your first play.\\nNote in order for a lantern to get a lot of actions, you need to be adding cards to it, which occur when you send people into the castle, and the scoring of courtiers and warriors that multiply them likely added as much, or more, than points you gained on the lantern.\\nAs for possibility of rules issues, one thing some overlook is that in the initial setup, you cannot have all the dark actions be of the same location; that triggers a re-seeding. See this thread.\\n\\nEven if that was followed correctly, a setup state with a lot of castle actions to trigger will cause a lot of early courtiers and a lot of cards added to lanterns, but one would think that all the players would be doing this as much as possible and so lanterns would be helping most fairly equally.\\nScores of every player are fully trackable throughout the game. There’s a few points added directly but most are from gardeners, courtiers, and warriors, and can be easily added up as the game progresses. If you were the only one putting people in castle and increasing your lantern, that’s on the others to catch up with. However, a game setup that has less initial openings to go to the castle won’t be able to build the lantern as fast.\\n\\nGene,\\nHave you tried to repeat this strategy?

Each game in our database has its own page, searchable from the large search box in the upper right corner of your screen, and those pages include forums to use to discuss issues specific to that game. When you reach the game\\'s main page, look for the toolbar below the stars where you rate the game to find the option for \"Forums\" and click on that to find them.\\nHappy gaming!\\n\\nWhy does the too floor of the castle have an Infiniti symbol but the rooms on the first and second floors do not?\\n\\nI believe this to be so you won\\'t forget, that there is no limit for the number of meeples you put there.\\nThere is of course no limit on the other floors as well, but the last room has 3 special places for the 1st ones to get there, and it may lead some to forget that after the 3 positions filled you can still take your meeples there.\\n\\n\\n\\nPublished yesterday at:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/157418/graphic-designer-d...\\nI\\'m sure that many here have seen it, but equally sure that some will have missed it, and will enjoy it.\\n\\nThank you so much for sharing this, Andrew. We hope you all find the article interesting!\\n\\n\\n\\nPlaying with more than two players, can i put a 4-white die on my personal domain  paying 2 coins, and in other turn stack it with a 6-white gaining 2 coins?\\n\\nYou cannot stack a die on your Personal Domain at all (Page 5 on the Rulebook, \"Stacking Dice\"). No matter how many players.\\n\\nThere\\'s also the \"no stacking\" icon printed in your personal domain board, in the lower half.\\n\\nThere\\'s also the \"no stacking\" icon printed in your personal domain board, in the lower half.\\n\\nIt would have been helpful if the twenty page rulebook had included that icon in the icon appendix?\\nI know you don’t stack on your personal board. However, the rules are poorly written. The icon is shown in the paragraph discussing the 1-2p game. By implication, that rule would only apply to 1-2p games.\\n\\nThe icon is also shown in the Personal Domain section on p. 8. And when reading the Stacking Dice item on p. 5, I took it as the general icon for no-stacking - as that\\'s the actual name of the section.\\nIn other sections of the rulebook where the icon is shown to remind the player that there\\'s no stacking on a 1-2p game, it has the accompanying \"2 player\" text to make it clear.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I took this to mean, that if all 5 cards on the 1st and 2nd floors only show one action then we need to completely re-do step 2 in the set-up.  But I have seen some comments from players on these forums that leads me to believe there is a chance this rule applies PER FLOOR rather than for the entire castle.  So just to clarify, which is it?  Because we regularly have the 2nd floor end up with two of the same during set-up even though the first floor almost always has 2 or 3 actions in it.\\nAnd also, this is only during initial set-up so once a Courtier moves and takes the card if the refill would cause a duplicate action situation then you would just play it as is and you wouldn\\'t put it back and draw a new one?  I don\\'t see any rules that would suggest we would do that, but I want to make sure I\\'m not missing anything.\\nTl;dr I want to clarify what Step 2 means in the rulebook and that Step 2 ONLY applies during set-up.  I ask because I have seen some posts from what I think are one of the developers mentioning English wasn\\'t their first language so I wanted to make sure that I\\'m interpreting this correctly.\\n\\nThe designer has commented somewhere - its only if ALL cards on those 2 floors have the same action symbol. And yes, only during setup.\\n\\nIt\\'s just as Andrew say. I\\'ll just add that the game makes a distinction between cost and action (or effect). The cost of the action is irrelevant here, it is just the action per se - castle, gardener, warrior - that matters.\\nIf all castle cards show the same action (castle/gardener/warrior), regardlessly of one having a Daimyo cost and others not, you\\'ll need to redo that setup step.\\n\\nThank you both, I thought we were doing it right but I wanted to make sure.  Appreciate it!\\n\\n\\n\\nI really like the game at three and two but if people want to play it at four I won\\'t. 4th player isn\\'t always terrible depending on starting conditions but I\\'ve played where it felt like 4th player was more than 10 points behind.

There are castle cards that trigger lantern. Place a courtier into that area. Take the card and choose the light coloured action that triggers the lantern. That card is now sitting on your personal board ready to be triggered again. Some of the top level castle cards offer lantern as a bonus - get there first and you trigger lantern twice. At 3rd action in a round there is a convergence between low and high dice values on the bridges which means the cost to take a lantern die is not significantly higher. And, if you have 1 or more coin cards in the lantern it may even be cheaper.\\n\\nI really like the game at three and two but if people want to play it at four I won\\'t. 4th player isn\\'t always terrible depending on starting conditions but I\\'ve played where it felt like 4th player was more than 10 points behind.

Based on this and other threads [1,2], I concluded that the solo opponent simply never activates anything on dice placement. On the contrary, the rule is very specific about when not to take action: never activate any action to place a die or a clan member. This implies that all other actions are activated. E.g. when they place a die in the castle that would give them passage of time, VP, or coins, I assume that the solo player would gain those.\\nHowever, there are complications with my interpretation.\\nFirstly, I noticed a bridge field card where if a gardener is placed, you can activate any white background castle action. Indirectly, that would mean that if the castle shows a white action that gives time/VP/coins, then indirectly you could activate that for the solo opponent. Seems like a bit too much playing/gaming/management for the solo opponent; generally they are very streamlined: flip a card and do one or two things with no or just one decision.\\nSecondly and lastly, what if an activated location shows multiple things, e.g. gain 1 food and 1 coin. Would the solo player only gain 1 coin?\\nSo, I think the actual problem is my interpretation of the rule. Let me quote it again:\\n> Your rival never activates any action to place any dice or any member of their Clan.\\nI think that my interpretation was:\\n> Your rival takes all actions, except the ones that have them place any dice or any member of their Clan.\\nBut the interpretation I probably (please confirm!) should have had is:\\n> You rival never takes any action when they place any dice or any member of their Clan.\\nThe \\'to place\\' is what has/had me confused. Any maybe Philippe too? Is this a language issue on my part? I\\'m not a native english speaker. Maybe, but I really don\\'t intend to point fingers, the designers/rulebook writers also aren\\'t native english speakers? Furthermore, my edition is the dutch edition, so there may be another layer of meaning being lost or changed in translation. I\\'m not trying to blame anyone, it\\'s just a fact of language and it happens (I\\'ve seen it countless of times) a lot in boardgames and their rulebooks.\\nSo, please confirm if the rule is simply: do not take any action when the Tokugawa Clan solo opponent places any dice or any worker.\\n[1]\\n\\n[2]\\n\\n(Thanks for this thread, Philippe! I ask here at the risk of too few seeing this question. If no correct answer is given within reasonable time, I\\'ll ask a new forum question.)\\n\\nI\\'m half-spanish and I\\'m fluent in spanish (castellano), so I looked at the spanish rulebook version of this rule. I assume it is the original, and that the english version is a translation. Here\\'s the spanish rule with a literal, word for word translation below:\\n> Nunca activa ninguna acción por la colocación de ninguno de los dados o los miembros de su clan.\\nNever activate no action for placing/due to the placement of no dice or members of their clan.\\n(Note that spanish uses a lot of double negation when they actually mean single negation. For example \\'never no things\\' actually means \\'nothing ever\\' where in english it would mean \\'always something\\'. But that\\'s a side step.)\\nThe spanish word \\'por\\' is the troublemaker, I suspect. It can both mean \\'any action due to the placement\\', or \\'any action to place\\'. I suspect the former was meant, as that feels more natural to my spanish language guts, but the english translators/editors took the second option.\\nIf that\\'s the correct interpretation, I suggest that any future printings correct this erratum, and that all other translations/distributors (e.g. the dutch version, that probably was translated from english for another layer of potential misinterpretation) are informed.\\n\\nNow also in its own thread:\\n\\nNow also in its own thread:\\n\\nFWIW, a lot of the rulebook issues are probably due to the translation issue. Google translate isn’t always a sure thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn one instructional video it was mentioned that when you end your movement with your Courtier on the second floor, after placing the Action card from your personal Domain into Lantern Area and placing the card from the room my Courtier just ended the movement you replace the card on the main board from the deck next to the rooms. This is all correct but he also mentioned that you can\\'t have the same dark Actions on the cards on any floor of the Castle.\\nI only found this condition in the setup section when you set up the game not during the game.\\nPage 2: Important: If all the cards in the Castle show exact same dark-background action, return those cards to their decks, shuffle them again and redo Step 2.\\nWould someone be able to confirm this is the case only when setting up the game?\\nThanks\\n\\nIn one instructional video it was mentioned that when you end your movement with your Courtier on the second floor, after placing the Action card from your personal Domain into Lantern Area and placing the card from the room my Courtier just ended the movement you replace the card on the main board from the deck next to the rooms.

It has four 20 page rulebooks, why is everything buried in an undifferentiated flood of text?\\n\\nThis only matters during setup. The relevant rule is on p. 2, under the Game Setup title, where I expected it to be. It\\'s on a nice callout box and all.\\nIt does not appear anywhere else because all castle cards having the same principal action anywhere other than during the setup does not matter.\\nThere may be problems with the rulebook alright (I find it fine), but I don\\'t think this is one of them.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo far I\\'m loving the game, and this isn\\'t a variant thread but rather a curiosity, I was hoping the designers might shed a bit of light upon.\\nI found the fact that the passage of time markers were stacked in player order counter to what I thought the order should be. The rules are clear that the tokes are arranged in turn order with  first player on top\\nThis means that first player will win ties if any other player didn\\'t move their marker. I know once the markers move whomever moved last would break any ties but i would have expected the markers to be in reverse turn order. This way the advantage in remaining earlier activing isn\\'t with the players that already had higher turn order.\\nI am assuming that NOT moving on the track at all is not the best strategy, but it was still a bit puzzling to me why the first player can get extra rewarded because of setup.\\n\\nThat’s not uncommon. Castles of Burgundy has the same approach for turn order.\\n\\nBasically, what it comes down to is if you\\'re unhappy with where you are in turn order, then you need to move your marker on the track.\\nAlthough I have seen at least one game (\\n\\nEvacuation\\n\\n) where players who are tied reverse their relative order from the previous turn.  I like this rule, but it is a little more fiddly.\\n\\nBasically, what it comes down to is if you\\'re unhappy with where you are in turn order, then you need to move your marker on the track.\\n\\nYep, this is about opportunity cost.\\nIf you\\'re the designated first player, the value of a Heron icon is significantly lower than the one perceived by the last player and vice versa.\\nIt falls on those players to evaluate what do they stand to gain or lose by maintaining the current round order for the following rounds.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn another forum from January, Devir mentioned a February reprint, at least in North America.

Do you see any issue with scoring your points with a farmer as soon as you place it? It can\\'t be removed or changed so I don\\'t see a reason not to score the points immediately.\\nSimilarly for a courtier: you could score 3 points immediately when a courtier reaches the first level of the castle, then add 3 more points as it moves up a level, etc. You would also score additional points for the courtier for each warrior you already have in place, and then add more points every time you add a warrior as well.\\nDo you see any issues with keeping a more accurate score throughout the game like this so everyone has a better understanding of where they stand? Otherwise, it seems like everyone hovers around only 5-10 points throughout the game, and then suddenly jump to 40-80 points at the very end.\\n\\nGood idea with gardeners. Though, maybe there will be an expansion that makes sense in post-game scoring\\nScoring courtiers and especially samurais will make the game too fiddly.\\nAs you play you will be able to quickly analyze your current situation and see who\\'s really winning. Also, knowing the score won\\'t affect your strategy much:\\n1) You always need to try to put out all gardeners.\\n2) You always need to put almost all samurai to 5 iron training ground.\\n3) you always need to promote your courtiers as high as possible.\\nSo enjoy the combos and care less about the result.

I get a little annoyed when designers bother to take up board space with a track and then barely use it until end game. I can do that with paper and pencil. In theatre they say if there\\'s a rifle hanging above the door in the first act, somebody better get shot by the end of the third act. I think in board games if there\\'s a point track running around the board, there better be points racking up during the game. Otherwise what\\'s the point?\\n\\nI ended up trying this, and while it was definitely nice to see everyone\\'s progress in real-time during the game, if you\\'re unsure that all points got counted along the way, it\\'s probably not possible to correct that. It might work better to count the additional fans that you earn during the game outside of farmers, courtiers, and warriors, and then you can double check your point score more accurately at the end from scratch in case there\\'s any doubt.\\n\\nThere’s a little discipline involved but apart from the courtiers x samurai multipliers I don’t see a lot of overhead scoring pieces as they are placed (or moved in the castle). I would not score multipliers before the end though, too prone to mistake adjusting as you go.\\nYou could argue that not scoring multipliers before game end voids the point of scoring anything else ahead but it may help you get a better feeling of how things are going for you / other players.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the anticipated play time for 4 newbies (one person would read the rules beforehand)?\\n\\nWe just had a 4p game yesterday. My SO and I we 6-8 plays, and two newcomers.

They\\'re just not as equiped to deal with AP as we are, and it showed. This game is very conducive to AP in my opinion, but we all had a great time and they\\'re looking forward to playing it again.\\n\\nI have played 7 times (2-3-4 players), and took between 65-80 mins.\\n\\nIt totalled to 2h after the teach.\\n\\nThat would have been my estimate as well. About 30m per person.\\n\\nIt probably depends on how experienced the players are in this type of game.\\nIf you are not used to planning ahead and comboing then your turns will be quick and won\\'t chain.\\nI would say that for gamers when they start playing this it is probably a 2 hour game at 4,and it probably speeds up with experience in this game.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe spent over an hour trying to set the game up.

When you get the feeling the game gets rolling it is already over. It really feels like that we play the game wrong or miss something. Two rounds with 3 Player only one got above 40 points but really close, one got 30+ and the other one 25+. How do you even reach the end of the influence row or 80+ points?\\n\\nThere is a learning curve to the game.  It takes awhile to see the combos that allow you to effectively chain your one action with multiple free actions.  You may take a simple action or two to get resources, and then take an action that allows you to take a free action and that free action leads to another free action.\\n\\nSeriously...it feels like the three rounds are way too less to score good points.

Two rounds with 3 Player only one got above 40 points but really close, one got 30+ and the other one 25+. How do you even reach the end of the influence row or 80+ points?\\n\\nI’ve seen games end with everyone under 40 points, and I’ve seen games end with a high score of 79 points. There’s a lot of set-up randomness in this game which can really influence how many points can be scored, so I don’t think it’s possible to compare one game to the next and come up with a “likely” or “average” good score - the only thing that matters is scoring more than your opponents in that particular game.\\n\\nIn this game points depend on the setup of the board, because it allows you good combos or it does not. So sometimes you reach hardly 40 points and sometimes you get to 60 points without problems. It\\'s the same with the influence row.\\nIn this game it is very important to \"read the board\" at the beginning of the game to prepare a good strategy.\\n\\nokay but everyone i played this game with so far didnt really liked it because it doesnt felt really rewarding. So i guess the only way to score many points is if your setup is lucky, you get many rewards for the right dice on floor one and get some luck throwing the dices and get to pick high dices? that is alot ifs .... i mean i like the mechanics but yeah .... game feels like it should go 4 or 5 rounds.\\n\\nBack when we had played out 6 times. The pink player was playing it for the first time on the 6th. A few considerations:\\n1)\\nSetup\\nis hugely impactful. No two games are the same as the setup determines what route may potentially haul big points, what route will potentially be relatively capped etc. And you need to be watchful because the ever changing cards may throw you a curve ball.\\nThe Passage of Time track\\nslots in that. How often and how heavily players will seek it depend on the setup.\\n2) The\\nClan Points track\\nseems to have those extra +40 and +80 tokens for people that likes to progress on it while counting points at the end of the game - like what we usually do on Brass or Gaia Project. How far you\\'ll actually go during the game via the red\\nis again dependant on the setup, but I\\'d wager no one\\'s scoring 40 with only red fans.\\n3) Again strategies will vary on a game to game basis, but it mostly revolves around\\nputting your meeples out\\n. If there\\'s a significant discrepancy between two players regarding how many clan members they\\'ve placed during the game, the final score will heavily favor the one that managed to put out the most.\\n4)\\nThree rounds\\nis chef\\'s kiss. I\\'ll touch on this later, but yeah, at first it thought it was a round too few or that we should have at least +1 turn per round. That was during my final turn on round 1 though!\\nThis game skyrocketed through our personal rankings - my SO\\'s and mine. I already had some expectations going in, but she was meeeh over it all the way through the unboxing and the teach. Heh, it quite took the wind out of my sails at first with her lack of enthusiasm. Now though? Lord how hard it is to make a case for tabling Spirit Island, Brass or Root (our other favorite games). She absolutely loves it.\\nBack on track: it being 3 rounds with 3 turns each makes it juuuuust right on our view\\nAs I said though, that\\'s an acquired perception. We did not feel that way at first, and I personally thought it was too short in player actions.\\n5) Been there, seen that. You\\'re most definitely not alone in those feelings. Everything you mentioned, from scoring to how tight the game feels, are very common\\nfirst impressions\\naround here. Keyword here being \"first\", though.\\nObviously everyone\\'s different, and you\\'re 110% entitled to dislike this little-ish euro. But I have not seen those first impressions stick around. Confirmation bias or whatever, it seems to me they all go away relatively quickly.\\nThey literally did on our table. During the very first round in my case.\\nThe chart above doesn\\'t make it clear, but the 3rd player that got in for their first time on our 6th game did not go over that beaten ground of \"not feeling it\". They loved it from turn 1, and did surprisingly well with 50+ points.\\nAnd yeah, they did put those meeples out.\\n\\nSo i guess the only way to score many points is if your setup is lucky, you get many rewards for the right dice on floor one and get some luck throwing the dices and get to pick high dices? that is alot ifs ....\\n\\nDouble posting as this was not available while I wrote mine, sorry.\\nLike I said, it feels like some routes will have a\\nhuge\\npotential depending on the setup, while others will be\\nrelatively\\ncapped. It lies on the player to see that from the beginning.\\nRegardlessly of setup, I think once you reach that 40s threshold you\\'ll hardly ever go lower. In my chart above the green player did score a 35 or so in their 5th game, but they quickly realized during the game how it wasn\\'t going to pay out and tried to adjust course on round 2. They\\'re trying emulate a previous strategy even though that particular board was very generous with a different route.\\n\\nokay but everyone i played this game with so far didnt really liked it because it doesnt felt really rewarding.

Because of the set up the overall score may be lower than the overall score in a different set up but that’s moot.\\nAlso, don’t underestimate the value of the dice on the lower side of the bridges. The greatest difference between dice on one side or the other is only a matter of 5 coins. OTOH, picking the low side die gives you a lantern action. These can be huge (more valuable than 5 coins) during the third round.\\n\\nYou have got to plan ahead and focus on obtaining the minimum of each type of resource you need to pull off the needed double and even triple combos!\\nAnd one courtier at the top of the castle or two at the second level will be worth more than three at the lower level of the castle…mitigated by the warrior multiplier, of course…\\n\\nSeriously...it feels like the three rounds are way too less to score good points. When you get the feeling the game gets rolling it is already over. It really feels like that we play the game wrong or miss something. Two rounds with 3 Player only one got above 40 points but really close, one got 30+ and the other one 25+. How do you even reach the end of the influence row or 80+ points?\\n\\nPlaying well you manage to deploy most of the meeple and reach 60-70 pts. Extremely good sessions might award even more (I saw a game with 90pts)\\n\\n\\n\\nI played 2 times so still new here. Please tell me I am wrong: my guess is that with 4 players the 4th player has small odds at winning (considering equal level of players, not my personal low skills). Sure you get to pick starting cards, but all actions in the game wil be more expensive, since the good dice are gone, the good spots are gone, and the spots have become more expensive because they are occupied bij higher dice.

And the negative consequences aren’t really that great.\\nFirst, if they play smart by getting Passage of Time movement they will only be 4th the first round, and could even be first in subsequent rounds.\\nSecond, since multiple dice can be played on a spot, it may well be cheaper for them and they can’t be totally blocked.from more than either a gardener action or a training grounds action during a round…which are likely available on cards in the castle or perhaps as a Personal Domain action.\\n\\nThe later you go in turn order the more effect you have on which Gardners will trigger as you can deplete the dice.\\n\\nI did find that the passage of time markers were stacked in player order, so that the first player wins ties if any other player didn\\'t move their marker.i would have expected the markers to be in reverse turn order. But the rules are clear about it so I guess it is tested and more balanced that way.\\n\\nYes, but if you move onto an occupied passage of time space, then your marker goes on top. Therefore, the later moving player can use that to their advantage for determining player order in a future round.\\n\\nYes, but if you move onto an occupied passage of time space, then your marker goes on top. Therefore, the later moving player can use that to their advantage for determining player order in a future round.\\n\\nThat\\'s true and fine and makes sense.\\nI just would have thought the starting stack should have been arranged opposite so that if no one moves it flips torn order rather than retaining first player\\'s position.\\n\\nIt is my experience (in 4 player games) that the 3rd and 4th player positions are competitive. I have won from 4th on a number of occasions that I can recall. The first or second pick of starting cards is advantageous, and it takes a little experience with the game to assess the randomized board to identify the best starting cards.\\n\\nI played 2 times so still new here.

I am not fully confinced (would love statistics somehow) , but at least I will give this game another try, and just work harder next time\\n\\nMy friend as well has feeling that the advantage of first or second pick of starting cards is not enough. I think it\\'s really depending on starting set-up and dice, but the biggest problem is that pre/last players hardly have enough coins to pay for placing lower value dice after first players used the highest values on their first turn.\\nSo, he came up with the idea of giving 2-3-4th player 1-2-3 coins in addition of their starting bonuses. You can give it a shot - I think it would be a good solution for your problem.\\n\\nThis issue came up in a 4p game today, and I don\\'t have enough plays to know for sure. In our game there seemed few early ways to get a heron bump. But all starting action cards (selected during setup) have a heron track bump on their reverse side. So placing a courtier in the castle and taking the card and replacing the starting action gets that heron bump into your lantern actions. I can see courtier and lantern actions needing to be an early priority if you are late in turn order. But awarding an extra coins at start also seems reasonable.\\n\\nIf there is a concern, you might find a way to make early dice drafting less rewarding. For example, you might use a board setup variant in which no room in the palace had duplicate dice colors. So each room on the second level would have one of each dice color.\\nI use this variant (but not for this reason).\\n\\nIf there is a concern, you might find a way to make early dice drafting less rewarding.

So each room on the second level would have one of each dice color.\\nI use this variant (but not for this reason).\\n\\nWell now I\\'m curious as to why you do it.\\n\\nI started doing it because it seemed simpler to explain. At some point I might un-vary the game to see if people prefer it as rulebooked.\\n\\nSo, we played our first game yesterday. It\\'s a single game, so those are impressions, not statements about the game, but we did have the feeling that there is a strong last player disadvantage.\\n- Selecting the cards first did not seem to compensate much for the downsides of playing last. We saw that cards have unequal ressources yield, but not that many differences and luck of the draw might make it even leaner. The starting action cards never got activated (replaced by a castle card before the first activation on the mat) and all their reverse sides were the same.\\n- Selecting last in our game on round 1 turn 1 meant taking a 3 instead of a 5 or 6, with all the double actions taken on the 1st level, and the only double action taken on the second level.\\n- This is compounded by the fact that the issue is not just taking the 4th action, but also the 8th and the 12th.\\n- If everyone should gain one influence in round 1 and you do so last, then you would become first on round 2, but conversely, if you cannot move and at least tie for first, as the last player in round 1 you would still be last on round 2.\\n- True, you are not stuck in that last position and can play earlier in rounds 2 and 3, but a) you need to actively dig yourself out, b) most importantly, on round 1 (and 2, to a lesser extent), the lantern is weak. This means that while playing last in round 3 is not a catastrophe at all because you get the lanterns bonus to compensate, in round 1, there is no real compensation for getting the weaker dice.\\n- Yes, taking the last die can give you an advantage for the gardeners. It may, or may not, it\\'s not necessarily a reliable compensation, but it is one nevertheless. Another small compensation can come in the form of playing \"middle\" dice with the lanterns bonus after other players have used the lowest numbers, but again, this is not much of a boon in round 1 where the \"issue\" lies.\\nAnyway, this is what we felt. I guess if it\\'s the case, not just a first impression, we can all start at 10 VP and auction for player order.\\n\\nIn my last game the third player picked the starting resources that included a vp card, and probably ran his lantern 10 to 15 times, and beat me (first player) by 5. I thought we both played pretty good, that card could have been the difference.\\nAs I said above the order of the stack is curious (ties should go to last player Imo), but besides that I don\\'t find it to have a turn order advantage.\\n\\nIn my last game the third player picked the starting resources that included a vp card, and probably ran his lantern 10 to 15 times, and beat me (first player) by 5.

Dismissing another opinion simply on number of play counts is not productive. Why is it erroneous?\\n\\nI think there is a way to raise questions or concerns. I am sure I don\\'t always fall on the right side of the line, but I do try.\\nI am sure that someone playing a game once or even 5 times and saying that something is broken or unbalanced will be offensive to a designer even if it is true.\\nDesigners for the most part test and think about every little thing for countless hours, to have someone claim that they did otherwise or that they weren\\'t perceptive enough to notice something is understandably offensive. Obviously certain things can fall thru the cracks. And sometimes no one tried something crazy in play testing to prove that it could be possible and game breaking. I think most players try to do the best they can in a game, and outlier strategies need someone to think of them, and try it in a game and for the other players to react/not react in certain ways to discover.\\nWith all that being said I do sometimes think that a certain game has a rule/feature that isn\\'t quite fitting my reference or playstyle and I will play with a house rule or a variant, but never before I have played it, and I always try to be nice about it on websites like this.\\nBoard game designers aren\\'t like professional athletes or movie directors. designers are fans of board games and are likely hanging out on BGG as much as we are, and they probably read all the threads about their games, what you write here is read by them, so consider that when you insult a game, that is someone\\'s work and passion project you have put down.\\n\\nAs a follow up to the post above and back to White Castle,\\nSomeone postulated that going last in this game puts them at a disadvantage, I then mentioned that in my game the last player was able to draft a card (vp in lantern bonus) that gave them more points than the margin of victory they won by. One could jump to the conclusion that the card is overpowered, and while that could potentially be true, that conclusion does not take into account how other players will deal with that card, will they specifically target lantern bonuses to deny the last player from taking advantage of it, or perhaps they can just take advantage of the big dice on the right side of the bridge knowing that the lantern bonus card player will focus on the dice on the right. There are just too many variables to take into account after a few plays to decide whether something like this is broken or unbalanced.\\nA counter might be a hypothetical game where you play the whole game, and in the last action of the game each player draws 1 card from the same deck, and that card decides the victor. If there is no way to plan/prepare/mitigate that luck than I would say that that part of the game is not balanced and potentially broken. That is clearly not the case for White castle or any game I can actually think of.\\n\\nIn the most recent game I played, the 4th player won by 3 points over the 1st player with other players close behind. We are all experienced players with the game. I was the 1st player.\\nThe 4th player read the board well and chose a starting packet that fitted a strategy. The start packet gave them 4 money and flipped to give lantern a mother of pearl. The starting action was a courtier. They had seen that the Wishing Well gave a mother of pearl and a choice of resource, so their first action was to take the highest available dice (a 5 I think) and go to wishing well. Their 2nd action was to take the highest available lantern dice and go to their personal board, paying the difference from money, triggering their lantern first to gain another mother of pearl and then sending a courtier to the gate and into the castle. The light action they chose gave them 2 money and triggered the wishing well, setting them up with resources for another courtier in a future turn. Their lantern now also contained a heron. I don’t recall exactly what they did for a 3rd action but they definitely moved on the passage of time track. Playing last in the round means you know exactly what you need to gain to move up the turn order, particularly as the later player wins ties. Neither of these first two actions can be blocked by other players.\\nBy the end of the game he had all 5 courtiers out and 2 each of gardeners and warriors. A late game personal board play on the courtiers row delivers the food resources for playing gardeners, having previously chosen a castle card with a beneficial action for that spot.\\nMy limited choice of start cards had no synergy with the board. I had a warriors action, some resources and iron in the lantern. Getting warriors out was easy, but you also need courtiers out to make the warriors score big, and that I struggled to do.\\nIn my opinion, White Castle is all about advance planning over several turns to link actions together in the most efficient way. Double castle actions only have value if they play into your strategy. If they don’t then they are a lost tempo and that will hurt your score. In general, if you have the most workers out, then you are going to be competitive for the win.\\n\\nIn my last game the third player picked the starting resources that included a vp card, and probably ran his lantern 10 to 15 times, and beat me (first player) by 5.

Dismissing another opinion simply on number of play counts is not productive. Why is it erroneous?\\n\\nRead the OP’s thread headline as well as his initial post, and then all of the subsequent posts that contradict it.\\nIt is indeed clearly erroneous to state unequivocally that in this game “the 4th player never wins.” The thread headline was not  in the form of a question (e.g., “Is it possible to win as the 4th player?”) but rather a firm conclusion.\\nSo I stand by my logical comment (based on comments here to the contrary and my own experience) that the conclusion is clearly erroneous.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis review first appeared on\\nPolyhedron Collider\\nand has been recreated here without some of the fluff, hyperlinks and swear words, so if you\\'d like to read the unabridged bells-and-whistles version you can do so\\nhere\\n.\\n\\nWhite Castle is an extremely tight euro dice placement game in which you take the role of a clan leader in Japan.  Throughout the game, you are going to send your Courtiers, your Warriors, and your Gardeners out into the land to curry favour with the Emperor so that you can earn your prestige.  The player with the most prestige at the end of the game wins.\\nThe entire game lasts nine turns, so, in case you missed it in the first paragraph.  This game is very tight.\\n\\nIn your turn you will pick up one die from one of the three bridges, here you\\'ll need to pick either the highest number die or the lowest number die and depending on its colour or its number you will place it on one of the action slots on the board (all of which change every game).  You will then fire off the action of that location.  And maybe some sub-actions.  And maybe some more sub actions; if you\\'ve been really, really clever.  Turn then passes to your opponent where they will do something similar.  However, no matter what they do, their action is pretty much guaranteed to utterly piss in your chips.  Play continues to the next player.  More chip pissing occurs and so on.  Do this three times and you finish the round, score some points, do some bonus end-of-round actions and realise how very wet your chips are.\\n\\nRepeat this process twice more and the game ends.  At some point in the third round you realise that you\\'ve not got nearly enough resources, nearly enough points, and that you need at least five more actions to pull off your plan, and you’ll also notice with some despair that you have somehow not even made it off the starting point of the score track.\\nThat won’t just happen in the third round (you’ll just notice it with more gravity in the final stage of the game), it will happen in each and every single turn.  You may well think that nine rounds will make for a pretty short game and that maybe just placing a single die will lead to pretty quick turns.  But, dear reader, what you don’t yet understand, is that each turn comes with an immense decision-making process.\\n\\nI would describe the White Castle as an Espresso Euro: it is everything you want from a Euro in a shot.  It has big, meaty decisions every step of the way.  In some ways, it\\'s hard to plan too far ahead because the game state changes so quickly.  You have to pay attention, you have to be thinking, you have to look for those synergies at every moment and it\\'s so easy to make a mistake.  You are always going to want one more of this resource, or one more money, or one more action.\\nLike all good Euros, there is a lot to try and do, and little time to do all of those things, and not enough resources to do all of them well.  Every resource is important, and is all too often scarce.  Each action needs to be thought through carefully.  The White Castle is a very unforgiving game, and in case you’ve not yet understood the severity of the core mechanism; the action economy of this game is extremely tight.  The torque has been ratcheted up, almost to breaking point, and you will feel that stress and tension from the first move to the last.\\n\\nYet somehow it is highly addictive fun, multiplayer or solo!\\n\\nI have yet to try it solo yet, that might be worth doing actually - I don\\'t usually like playing games solo but I\\'m quite tempted with this one.  Thanks for reminding me it has a solo mode!\\n\\nI have yet to try it solo yet, that might be worth doing actually - I don\\'t usually like playing games solo but I\\'m quite tempted with this one.

Es lag auf den Demo-Tischen bei Devir und das Interesse war so groß, dass ich daran vorbeiging, obwohl ich wusste, dass die niederländische Ausgabe von 999 Games bereits in den Geschäften zu Hause lag.\\nThe White Castle (oder The White Castle) reiht sich mühelos in eine Reihe von beliebten Euro-Worker-Spielen mit japanischem Thema der letzten Jahre ein: Bitoku, Iki, Gugong. Es wird in einer ähnlichen Fantasiewelt gespielt, und wenn man sich in die richtige Stimmung versetzen will, sollte man vor allem lesen, was die Schöpfer einem sagen wollen:\\nDer Reiher fliegt über den Himmel von Himeji, während der Daimio von der Spitze des Schlosses aus die Bewegungen seiner Diener beobachtet. Gärtner pflegen den Teich, in dem die Koi-Karpfen leben, Krieger halten auf den Mauern Wache und Höflinge drängen sich vor den Toren, weil sie sich nach einer Audienz sehnen, die sie näher an die inneren Kreise des Hofes heranführt. Bei Einbruch der Nacht werden die Laternen angezündet und die Arbeiter kehren zu ihren Clans zurück.\\nBlumige Sprache, breit und mit Bildern. Das gefällt mir, mense!\\nDiese Autoren sind Sheila Santos und Israel Cendrero. Besser bekannt unter ihrem Künstlernamen Llama Dice, hat das Duo zusammen mit Devir auch den erfolgreichen Roman Die rote Kathedrale geschrieben.\\nIn Die weiße Burg lassen wir das Moskau von Iwan dem Schrecklichen hinter uns und erkunden die imposanteste Festung des modernen Japans, die Burg Himeji. Hier weht die Flagge des Sakai-Clans unter dem Kommando von Daimio Sakai Tadakiyo.\\nDas Weiße Schloss ist ein Spiel im europäischen Stil mit Mechanismen zur Ressourcenverwaltung, zum Platzieren von Spielern und Würfeln, um Aktionen durchzuführen. Während des Spiels, das sich über drei Runden erstreckt (man hat nur 9 Züge, 3 Mal pro Runde), schicken die Spieler Mitglieder ihres Clans, um die Gärten zu pflegen, das Schloss zu verteidigen oder auf der sozialen Leiter des Adels aufzusteigen. Am Ende des Spiels erhalten die Spieler auf verschiedene Weise Siegpunkte.\\nDas erste, was auffällt, ist, dass die Schachtel des Spiels viel kleiner ist als die ähnlicher Spiele dieser Kategorie. Sie hat die Größe einer Carcassonne-Schachtel, was fast den Eindruck erwecken könnte, dass The White Castle ein Spiel von ähnlicher Qualität/Schwierigkeit ist. Und das ist es auch nicht. Für seine dreißig Euro bekommt man viel mehr (was ein Schnäppchen ist).\\nWenn man die Schachtel öffnet, stellt man fest, dass es kein Inlay gibt und der ganze Platz mit Spielmaterial gefüllt ist. Und das ist verdammt clever! Die Schachtel ist prall gefüllt (während ich das schreibe, frage ich mich, woher der Ausdruck \"prall\" eigentlich kommt - das muss ich gleich mal nachschlagen).\\nAlso eine kleine Schachtel, aber das Spielbrett hat eine normale Größe. Er besteht nur aus mehr Feldern. Er ist übersichtlich gestaltet und sieht auch nicht zu überladen aus. Das gefällt mir, weil ich mich immer ärgere, wenn ein Spielbrett wie ein Gemälde von Hieronymus Bosch aussieht.\\nAuf der mittleren Tafel des Spielplans befindet sich die Burg Himeji. Sie ist in mehrere Zonen unterteilt. Der größte Teil des Spielfelds befindet sich in der Burg selbst, mit dem Raum der tausend Teppiche, in dem sich die Höflinge in drei Stufen nach oben arbeiten müssen, bis sie den Kreis erreichen, der dem Daimio am nächsten ist. Dort befinden sie sich in seinem Einflussbereich, und das ist die höchste Belohnung. Dort befinden sich auch der Teich und die Gärten, die von den Gärtnern akribisch gepflegt und instand gehalten werden. Hier kann sich jeder auf unbestimmte Zeit entspannen und die Schönheit der Gärten bewundern. Ein weiterer wichtiger Bereich sind die Mauer und die Außenanlagen des Schlosses, wo die Krieger patrouillieren und Wache halten.\\nSchließlich gibt es noch den Bereich der drei Brücken, wo die drei Arten von Würfeln gesammelt werden, die zur Durchführung von Aktionen verwendet werden können. Diese Pappbrücken sind ein ziemlich überflüssiger Zusatz im Spiel. Mich juckt das schon bei Everdell.\\nNeben dem großen Spielplan befindet sich die persönliche Domäne eines jeden Spielers, der Teil, in dem er seine Ressourcen aufbewahrt und Zugang zu seinen 15 Arbeitern hat.\\nDas Spiel wird in drei Runden gespielt - Jahre nach den Regeln. Als Rundenmarker ist ein wilder Koi-Karpfen abgebildet - auch ein bisschen übertrieben.\\nIn diesen drei Runden hat jeder Spieler drei Züge. Insgesamt kommt man also nur neunmal zum Zug. Das ist ziemlich wenig. Vor allem, wenn ein Spiel über zwei Stunden dauert. In jeder Runde hat man nur zwei (manchmal drei) Aktionen. Auch das ist nicht viel.\\nWas ist es also, das im Spiel so viel Zeit in Anspruch nimmt?\\nDie Verarbeitung der Folgen von Aktionen und ihre Auswirkungen auf die Ressourcenverwaltung und die Punktevergabe brauchen Zeit. Jeder Zug dauert mehr als drei Minuten, so dass man (bei einem Spiel mit vier Spielern) jedes Mal zehn Minuten warten muss, bis man wieder am Zug ist.\\nDas ist eine lange Zeit, wenn man ein ungeduldiger Schlipsträger ist - so wie ich. Doch wie durch ein Wunder hat mich das in The White Castle überhaupt nicht gestört. Wahrscheinlich, weil es viele Veränderungen während der Züge der anderen Spieler gibt, die sich auch auf deine Strategie auswirken. Man muss also - kurz gesagt - ein bisschen dranbleiben. Für mich war es - trotz meiner ADS-Komponente - faszinierend genug, um mich nicht ablenken zu lassen. Ein großes Plus!\\nWas ich davon gehalten habe?\\nFaszinierend. Aber das habe ich ja schon gesagt. Ich fand es fesselnd. The White Castle ist ein Spiel, dessen Thema sich gut in die Spielmechanik einfügt und dessen Spielablauf fesselt. Es unterscheidet sich nicht übermäßig von anderen Euro-Spielen, aber dennoch gibt es kein anderes Spiel wie The White Castle - ich weiß auch nicht, wie ich es sonst beschreiben soll: Es fesselt.\\nWas mir gefällt, ist, dass es zwei Dinge gibt, die ich normalerweise sehr schätze:\\nDer Gewinner des Spiels steht erst nach dem Endstand fest - am Ende des Spiels.\\nDa ist kaum Glück im Spiel.\\nIn so einem Fall, mit diesen Pluspunkten, verdient ein Spiel bei mir immer einen Extrapunkt: 8/10 und ich spiele es gerne wieder.\\n\\nBewertung für Bordspelwereld durch: Dick  (MetDick),\\nZuvor gepostet auf: 13-10-2023, mit einer Bewertung von:\\n8/10 Sterne\\nLink zu dieser Bewertung:\\nhttps://www.bordspelwereld.nl/de/bewertungen/neueste-bewertu...\\nDiese deutsche Übersetzung wurde aus dem Niederländischen von DeepL erstellt.

So obviously we always did the castle action first and than had a stronger lantern action. But what if you do the castle action and then take that card that shows the castle action you just activated as first black die action? Do you still do the lantern action of that card because it was the action when you placed the die or do you do the black die action in that line of what ever the next card says that gets put in that slot?\\nThx for feedback.\\n\\nThe action you triggered with the die(the old card)\\n\\nTricky case!

Pretty sure the rulebook is correct in this instance.\\nEdit: just found the bit in the video, that is weird, it seems to imply you can only move from the lateral rooms to the one directly above, and to be fair the arrows on the board (which I\\'ve never noticed) also imply this. That just seems wrong though. I\\'d be interested in hearing clarification but if that is true that movement is restricted in that way that seems like a silly rule IMO. For anyone interested it\\'s at 24:30 in the devir video\\n\\nThe rulebook is 100% correct. It does not matter what room you\\'re in, just the floor.\\nThe other official (?) How to Play by Meeple University is in line with the rulebook.\\nI guess those are remnants of an older version of the rules. There\\'s a similar bit in the Meeple University video as well about there needing to be at least 1 of each Principal Action in the castle cards - that was an outaded rule that made it to the video.\\n\\nAs above; L/R/C doesn\\'t matter. The bottom three floors can move into the middle two floors. The middle two floors can move into the top floor.\\n\\n\"each Principal Action in the castle cards\" rule is still there. It\\'ll be really hard to start otherwise\\n\\n\"each Principal Action in the castle cards\" rule is still there. It\\'ll be really hard to start otherwise\\n\\nActually it is not.

It is no longer so.\\nEdit\\n:\\n\\nHere\\'s Isra\\n\\nratifying it.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy first solo attempt I had heard the ai was over powered so I went on easy.

I have now played several times, with 2/3/4 players, with amateurs and geeks.\\nI have hereby collected some constructive feedback, for the publisher, the designers, maybe for the next round of production:\\nA) main critic point: this kind of game is not a family game, this game will only work for experienced gamers that enjoy more than a little strategy and brain effort. This game will not be picked as a gift from grandma for her gandson, chosen by chance. That means that aiming for a 30 EUR price and a relatively small box size does not make much sense IMHO. The total amount of sales would not drop big, if the price and the box size would go up 25%, but this would work better for all enjoyers of this game: larger box, larger cards, bigger coins etc\\nB) what is reason that some resources are using the punchboard-counting mechanism, but others don\\'t ? Personally, I didn\\'t like the Terraforming Mars resource couting cubes. I don\\'t completely hate the punched out holes for counting, but it feels inconsistent to have coins and Daimyos, but not the rest - IMHO go for all the same or all via punched holes.\\nC) I wonder what was the decision behind the player colors + the colors of the bridges? we have red twice. an orange or a grey or maybe a purple would fit better, don\\'t you think? Or are the bridge colors linked to some japanese cultural element?\\nD) as for A) the game would have been perfectly fine, if the components \"round indicator fish\" and the \"order indicator cranes\" were not designed as large and as expensive as they are right now. The beautiful meeples and the bridges are already perfectly fine and express the fine design and the production value. In order to maybe keep the price low by also increasing some components (like the box size), these elements could also be simpler/smaller, what do you think?\\nE1) some icons on the garden cards are a little to small to be seen from across the table (the victory points), especially if the board is so wide (landscape orientation).\\nE2) maybe a re-orientation of the board areas would also improve the ease of reading for all players across the table (go for more square or portrait orientation for the entire game board)\\nF) smaller question: it feels like the \"warrior times courtier\" victory points at the end are much lower than the courtier or the gardener victory points by themselfs, in the games that we played. Community, what is your take on this? Do you think that it could be tweaked / buffed in a future release? If the training yard actions are not helpful for a specifiy game, there is less incentive to put a warrior out.\\nThanks for all your feedback, I hope that my thoughts and suggestions don\\'t come along as rude, but rather as ideas and worries. No native englishman - sorry for potential mistakes and unclear statements.\\n\\nA) main critic point: this kind of game is not a family game, this game will only work for experienced gamers that enjoy more than a little strategy and brain effort.

The total amount of sales would not drop big, if the price and the box size would go up 25%, but this would work better for all enjoyers of this game: larger box, larger cards, bigger coins etc.\\n\\nI\\'m a gamers gamer, and I prefer (in fact relish in) the small box size. I find the association you\\'re making (small size as enticement for non-gamers) questionable, and more than presumptuous.\\nTo me, the game is all about minimalism, and the small footprint plays into that theme (which then also plays out in the economy of actions you have during the session).\\nNothing really to add to your other commentaries. I do not share the majority of the concerns, but I mostly play two player, and the garden cards - for example - aren\\'t too far from any one player. Not minimizing those, just explaining why I\\'m not addressing them.\\n\\nF) smaller question: it feels like the \"warrior times courtier\" victory points at the end are much lower than the courtier or the gardener victory points by themselfs, in the games that we played. Community, what is your take on this? Do you think that it could be tweaked / buffed in a future release? If the training yard actions are not helpful for a specifiy game, there is less incentive to put a warrior out.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen this claim several times and find it so interesting. We\\'ve only played 5 times but all 5 times so far the winner has largely ignored gardeners and gone heavy on courtier + warrior, the most recent one scoring 77 points. Maybe we\\'re just not good enough yet to get even higher scores but gardener has felt like a spot you put 1 person early and then largely ignore for us.\\n\\nA) Disagree strongly. As a serious gamer I am very pleased that Devir uses small boxes. I wish more publishers would follow suit. I have limited space for games. Smaller boxes mean more games. I for one do not consider Large box = serious game. If it did,\\n\\nwould be the most serious game in my collection. It is not. It is much lighter than\\n\\nwhich has one of the smallest boxes in my collection.\\nB) Design as published makes sense to me. The three trackers are used in end game scoring the same way. This makes it easy to score these.\\nC) As a colourblind gamer I appreciate the colour choices made in this game.\\nD) I would much rather pay for this little bit of bling than for a bigger box which would prevent me from buying this brilliant game.\\nE) Agreed. Some of the icons are a little small. Also some of the icons on the personal boards are a little confusing to new players.\\nF) I think you make decisions based on the rules of the game. If you feel one particular point source is less useful to you, then don\\'t use it. Or play a different game that suits you better.\\n\\n> A) main critic point: this kind of game is not a family game, This game will not be picked as a gift from grandma for her gandson, chosen by chance. if the price and the box size would go up 25%, this would work better for all enjoyers of this game\\n\\nI absolutely disagree.\\n1) This was never meant to be a family game, this is a euro. And btw my relatives and friends with ZERO gaming experience enjoy this game a lot.\\n2) There is NOTHING better about bigger box. The small box and low price are among the top things I love about this game. I can take this box anywhere in my bag and I don\\'t have to allocate 30 cm by 30 cm for it. And the price was the key factor for one of my friends to buy it the day I showed it to him.\\n3) 30 EUR is perfect price. Who said that games need to be expensive? You want an expensive game — there is plenty of Voidfall/Oathworn/Hoplomacus out there.\\n\\nB) what is reason that some resources are using the punchboard-counting mechanism, but others don\\'t ? but it feels inconsistent to have coins and Daimyos, but not the rest - IMHO go for all the same or all via punched holes.\\n\\nFrom here I start to doubt that you understand the game. MoP, iron and rice have limit AND their level comverts to VPs in the endgame, money do not have a limit, seals are converted at a different rate. The player pad is one of the most elegant pieces in modern gaming,\\n\\nC) I wonder what was the decision behind the player colors + the colors of the bridges? we have red twice. an orange or a grey or maybe a purple would fit better, don\\'t you think? Or are the bridge colors linked to some japanese cultural element?\\n\\nYou said the criticism will be constructive and now you insist on your taste.\\n\\nD) \"round indicator fish\" and the \"order indicator cranes\". In order to maybe keep the price low by also increasing some components (like the box size), these elements could also be simpler/smaller\\n\\nNow you contradict yourself, do you want the game to be cheaper or pricier? IMO the absurd size of the fish is the funniest thing in this game, btw. I love it.\\n\\nE1) some icons on the garden cards are a little to small to be seen from across the table (the victory points), especially if the board is so wide (landscape orientation).\\n\\nYou mostly care about the effect the gardener gives, although I can share the following insight with you: stone gardens are 1—3 pts, green gardens are 6—9 pts. I didn\\'t check the actual cards, but you can keep this in mind.\\n\\nE2) maybe a re-orientation of the board areas would also improve the ease of reading for all players across the table (go for more square or portrait orientation for the entire game board)\\n\\nThe board is perfect from all angles.\\n\\nF) Do you think that it could be tweaked / buffed in a future release? If the training yard actions are not helpful for a specifiy game, there is less incentive to put a warrior out.\\n\\nWarriors may give more pts in the game than courtiers. The game is perfectly balanced and interconnected on many levels. I suppose you have to play and analyze more before making such bold statements.\\nThe only thing I lack in the game is gardeners variability. Although it also makes sense.\\nI do hope the third part of the trilogy will share the box size and the elegance with the Red Cathedral and the White Castle.\\n\\nA) I appreciate it being a big euro in a small box - size and cost both. The components fit fine now even with 2 rulebooks, but I did have to put some thought into how to pack it and had to fish a few baggies out of my messy drawer to accommodate everything in a way that could expedite both set up and reboxing.\\nThe coins are indeed meh. Same goes for the dice: the coral ones are beautiful but the others even draw some remarks from my SO.\\nEverything else seems and feels fine to mee. I\\'m actually a big fan of the artwork and design, even more so considering the relatively low cost.\\nAll things considered, I\\'m happy with it. Just the lack of baggies that was kind of hard to justify.\\nNow talking about the difficulty of the game, the rules are a breeze and in our experience the game is beautifully easy to play. Even my non-gaming mother can get ahold of the gameplay. To play it well though? Heh, I don\\'t think she\\'ll ever break the 20 point mark haha\\nB) Those resources are not scored the same, have special use cases, and have different caps - with money having no caps at all.\\nI love keeping track of my resources with an actual track like in Project Gaia or how we do with food/iron/mp here, but I don\\'t find it to be an issue at all.\\nC) The red bridge is actually iconic on the real Himeji castle. I guess they tried to accommodate it by having the dice coral instead of red. I guess they could go with another player color, but red is so quintessential in board games...\\nI\\'m happy with the end result.\\nE) That has not been a problem for us yet. Only the leftmost dice that can be hard to see depending on how we sit around the table.\\nF) There has not been a single game on our table wherein the Warriors did not play a significant part on the final score. Granted, not near as much as Courtiers, but there have been games where gardeners were not sought out at all due to the setup. I\\'d chalk it up as being a consequence of the randomness of the setup.\\nCourtiers being the real deal make sense due to the theme of the game.\\n\\nWow. Sorry, but I think the OP’s criticisms are either inapplicable, questionable, or very minor, like having to use your some of your own small baggies (I have tons of them) and bead type containers or similar for the coins and daimyo seals. I have no idea what the criticism of the wonderful atmospheric (and thematically appropriate) bridges means.\\nMy wife likes the game a lot and doesn’t care for overly complex games. It requires a 2-3 plays to “get it” but after that it’s not only a great game but eminently replayable.\\nI did upgrade the Meeples with these great Etsy stickers:\\n\\nFor those of you who mention difficulty repacking the game, I highly recommend this insert if you have access to a 3D printer:\\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6276022\\n\\nI\\'d rather pay slightly more for a smaller box if anything. Space is a challenge. Smart trays, compact boxes are a delight! (Also less to transport, and less material, better for the environment)\\n\\nFor those of you who mention difficulty repacking the game, I highly recommend this insert if you have access to a 3D printer:\\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6276022\\n\\nIs there any lid lift with this?\\n\\n\\n\\nHi there\\nFirst time playing and I had a question about the “Well Action”. I understand that when you decide to place dice on your turn at the well you get coins equal to the difference plus the daimyo seal and other bonuses, but when you take the “Well Action” due to activating a card, do you also get coins? If so how is that determined? Or just the resources?\\n\\nNo coins - there\\'s a few actions like that that will let you \"use\" another die space but you won\\'t get coins there either. You only every get the coin difference when you phyiscally are placing the die on the space.\\n\\nThanks so much! Appreciate it\\n\\n\\n\\ni like the Lantern mechanism (and many other things about TWC).\\nDoes it remind you of any specific mechanisms in other games?

I\\'m just interested in any answers you may have.\\n\\nA vague corollary is your tableau in\\n\\n, though one HUGE difference is your engine runs ALL THE TIME in Earth, vs. maybe never in The White Castle.\\nIf you\\'re unfamiliar, in Earth there are 4 actions available to players on their turn. One is associated with the color green, another with red, another with blue and the last with yellow. Those last three also have an association with a \"rainbow\" color. Actions on cards placed in your tableau have associations with these colors as well.\\nWhenever a player takes an action, ALL players (active and otherwise) trigger the cards in the tableau associated with that color. So, in the example below, if somebody chose the yellow action, all the marked powers would trigger, starting at the top and going to the right (then repeating for each row below).\\n\\nThis speaks to the \\'player created row of rewards\\' aspect of the lantern action, but not the \"consolation prize for selecting a low powered die\" aspect of said mechanism.

Highlighting \"planned\" because I see it as the essential element of the game - that old chestnut: failing to plan is planning to fail (IIRC)\\n\\nSucks when that happens but it seems fairly clear that you need to do the actions in the order in the rules (Lantern fully, then Daimyo bonus).\\nSince timing is important in this game for other things (e.g. order of placing and paying for dice, then lantern, then action) it\\'s not entirely out of character.\\n\\n\\n\\nI believe the reference card that comes with the game does a pretty good job explaining the multiple worker allocation on one side.\\nOn the other side though, i think the iconography about the dice drafting is confusing.\\nI want to make sure that i understand the reasoning behind it, so I can explain to my game group.\\nHow do you interpret each row?\\nHere is my take on it:\\n1-pick the left or right most dice in a bridge (activate lantern, if it is the left one)\\n2-place the dice in the castle, well or personal board and pay (or receive) the coin difference\\n[here where it starts to get confusing]\\n3-activate the lantern only if a left dice was picked\\n4-execute the dice action according to the position\\nSorry for any English mistakes, it is not my main language.\\nThanks!\\n\\nI\\'ve never actually felt the need to look at the reference card, partly because the rules for the game are relatively simple and intuitive, but also because I agree with you that the iconography is not particularly helpful. But I\\'d say the steps you describe are a clear and accurate representation of dice placement\\n\\nHey! The card depicts the flow of a turn:\\n1) Pick a die from either the left or right side of any bridge\\n2) Place the die and resolve the difference in coins\\n3) Gain the Lantern Rewards, if applicable\\n4) Carry out the action or actions activated by your die placement\\nBy resolving the difference in step 2, we\\'re referring to either paying or earning it in coins.\\nEdit\\n: I should have added that I generally love the iconography of the game. I don\\'t think we ever had to look up anything from game 2 onwards. The only bit of iconography that I felt lacking here in the Player Aid, is that they tried to convey what sort of spaces you can place your dice on in the second row but there\\'s no icon for the\\nOutside the Walls\\narea (p. 6 of the Rulebook).\\n\\nOh, it should be noted that the Player Aid reflects the numbered steps from pages 4-5 of the rulebook. So, row #1 represents step #1 from p. 4, row 2 reflects step 2 from p. 5 and so on and on.\\n\\nI too found one side easy to parse, and the other side a cryptic nightmare of humorous ambiguity.\\nI probably could have teased it out, but my brain always just went NOPE, and moved on after a brief glance.\\nThe rules are easy enough that I never really needed a reminder of ... whatever they\\'re trying to remind me of there.\\n\\nThe rules are easy enough that I never really needed a reminder of ... whatever they\\'re trying to remind me of there.\\n\\nAgreed.

It took me waaaay too long to realize the top graphic was depicting things hidden underneath the die-cut bridges.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnyone know what the decree cards do?\\n\\nSome starting resource cards give you them and they add to your lantern bonus at the start of the game.\\n\\nAnyone know what the decree cards do?\\n\\nI too was confused when I first started. If you don\\'t get them as a starting resource they can be put in the box - they\\'re referenced, and only come into play, via your starting resource cards.\\n\\nMuch appreciated you both\\n\\n\\n\\nI love bigger euro games, Scythe and Lost Ruins of Arnak are 2 of my favorites. So I am coming from the place of someone who would choose to only play euros if I had to.\\nThis game hit the spot. Relatively small footprint for a euro game and once you get everything stored away in a reasonable manner, doesnt take any longer than others to get to the table.\\nThe mechanics are easy to grasp once you get through it. Dice drafting and trying to combo moves in your turn to get as much done in the 9 total turns you are given. Simple enough.\\nWhere this game really excels is the gameplay loop is so well play tested, you always feel like you are being rushed, but have enough time to make some really game changing decisions within a single turn. The way everything interacts with each other during each turn makes the combos crazy if you think a few steps ahead.\\nThe points come from so many places it is difficult to keep track of who is winning at any given moment, making you feel less focused on beating the other players and more focused on just doing the best you can. There is minimal player interaction - just when you plan your dice drafting you may stop the other players gardeners from giving them more resources at the end of the round. I find this okay because it is designed to be more of a solo game with comparing points at the end.\\nThe art is phenomenal and really wraps the theme up nicely. There is some short flavor texts throughout the rulebook for essentially every section of the board and they are quite interesting if you are into that kind of thing.\\nUltimately, this game feels polished. The designer obviously plastered this a ton and got everything dialed in. Just the right amount of turns to feel the rush, but still get a lot of work done. Resources aren\\'t scarce, but they aren\\'t plentiful either so manage them with care. This may be my favorite euro of 2023, and with a bit more time with it on the table, it may be my favorite euro of all time.\\n\\nThe relatively short play has been criticized but it’s a real plus for many gamers…\\n\\nI\\'d much rather be left wishing for one more turn of a game than regretting how a game lasted one turn too long.\\n\\nThe relatively short play has been criticized but it’s a real plus for many gamers…\\n\\nI\\'d much rather be left wishing for one more turn of a game than regretting how a game lasted one turn too long.\\n\\nOr lagged in the middle, which coincidentally has been noted by some to be an issue with a contender for best 2023 medium euro:\\n\\n…\\n\\nUnderstood!

That seems straightforward enough. On the headings for The Castle (page 6) and Outside the Walls (page 7) it specifically says “2 players” and the no stacking icon. On page 8 it also shows the no stacking icon next to The Personal Domains, but doesn’t say “2 players” because regardless of the number of players there is never any stacking there.\\nThe Well is where I’m confused (page 7).

We only play two player in my household, but contend that the value at the well is always 1, no matter what dice were placed there in the past (we don\\'t cover the slot, but place within the space).\\nEdit: While I still cannot say with 100% certainty we are playing it correctly, it stands to reason that you ALWAYS should be able to place at the well, given it\\'s a dump spot (a \"I have nowhere else to place\" option). Thus, it seems this wouldn\\'t hold if you stacked the dice, supplanting the 1 with higher values (since people without money wouldn\\'t be able to pay ). For this reason, I feel we\\'re playing it correctly, else it break the game.\\n\\nYou can ALWAYS go to the well. No limits on dice going there. It’s the one exception and it’s in the rules under The Well.\\n\\nOn top of what everyone else has already said, the stacking is allowed on a 3p+ game on the spaces framed by that neat golden box.\\nThe Well has the infinite symbol to remind you how stacking isn\\'t really applicable there.\\nThe rulebook even shows that the previously placed die (the coral/orange one) is not covering the printed die. So technically you just place the dice on the well space when talking that action.\\n\\nOn double checking I think this answers it. The two dice at The Well picture are not stacked.\\n\\nDice at the Well are not stacked\\n\\nYep, at any player count the dice at the well are both not stacked and infinite.\\n\\nYou aren\\'t stacking at the well. Any number of players can go to the well, but the die aren\\'t stacked. They are just places around the well as you see in the rules about the well!\\nHope this helps!\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to have White Castle on Board game arena, please vote here:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/114907/proposed-boardgame...\\nLet’s make this happen so that we can all play online\\n\\nHere\\'s a direct link to the game on the list so you don\\'t have to go searching for it:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/114907/proposed-boardgame...\\n\\nWould you consider changing your title to something else ?

Now for the impact that it has on the gameplay, that\\'s subjective but as I said I think it is very minor and that most people get it right.\\nThe erratum is actually just a clarification. No component change, no rewriting of the rules. They\\'ll just add a line saying you can only chain a Personal Domain action once - as in, when you take a given action and said action has the effect of triggering the personal domain action, that chaining/comboing can only happen once per turn. Something along those lines.\\nAll in all I do believe that White Castle deserves the praise it\\'s been receiving. It\\'s a surprisingly good euro considering the size and cost. It is easy to play, hard to master, has tons of replayability and a beautiful production.\\nEven considering the iconography hiccup above (gardener silhouette), the production value is high with a beautiful visual design.\\n\\n\\n\\nHi there! I\\'ve tried to find a clear answer, but didn\\'t succeed on that.\\nLet\\'s imagine I have all my warrior-meeples on my personal board and I don\\'t have any Action card (for simplicity reasons) what is correct order of actions among those below?\\nA) I place a white dice. Then I take 0 pearls. Stop\\nB) I place a white dice. Then I take 0 pearls. Then I can spend 1 pearl to perform warrior action.\\n\\nI have a feeling that you don\\'t understand what the personal board actions entail. They do not give you the ability to place a character of the corresponding line. There is no \"warrior action\".\\nWhat they provide you is:\\n- every resource that is visible in the line in which you place the die, so the more pawns of that specific type you have already placed the more resources you will get\\n- the corresponding action of the action card on your player board (which may allow you to place a character, depending on what card it is).\\nSo, if like you say all your samurais are still on your board, when you play a white die, you gain a single mother of pearl (because there is one printed on the left of the pawns you will always get at least this one), then resolve the action of your action card that is on the bottom row.\\nOn the opposite, if you had placed all of your samurais already, yo would gain 4 mother of pearl, one seal, and resolve once your lantern bonus, before activating the bottom row action on your action card.\\n\\nHi there!

To which I will add:\\nYou will always have an action card. You get one at the beginning of the game and the only way to remove it it to replace it with one you get from the castle using a Courtier action.\\nSo the correct answer is\\nC) Place a white die.

I imagine that one colour is generally better than the other (I forget the way round they go, but I think yellow is “better” than blue?).

Fun game. Crazy how little you seem to be able to accomplish on one’s initial play. Practice likely makes perfect, but I really do wonder who is routinely scoring above 80!\\n27~ for me to my partner’s 17 in the first game.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that you will have a relative score ceiling depending on the setup (double dice tiles in the first floor of the castle, actions in the garden, and actions in the training yard that synergize really well) and the dice rolls themselves will also affect how well you\\'re able to do. (Although, not as much as the tiles setup) So, it\\'s difficult to compare scores across multiple plays. I have mainly played solo but my scores have ranged from 48 to 102.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you draft dice,  the dice shift to fill in the missing space.  If the final die in the space was on the right side of the bridge,  does it slide over to become the lowest? Or does it remain in the right side?\\n\\nIt remains on the right side.\\n\\nNo. The space left by a die in one bridge\\'s end, is filled with the die next to that space (if it exists), so if the space left is the rightermost, the last die will be then the higher; if the space left was the leftermost, the last die will be the lower one.\\n\\nThe rule reads:\\n\"If there are still dice on the central part of the bridge after the die is taken, [only end dice may be taken] the die nearest the newest vacant spot is moved onto it without changing its value.\"\\nConsider this set-up:\\nThe bridge holds a 1, 3, 5, and 6, arranged left to right as the rules require.\\n1 is taken, 3 slides over to replace it. Result: 3, blank, 5, 6.\\n6 is taken, 5 slides over to replace it. Result: 3, blank, blank, 5.\\n3 is taken, there are no dice on the central part of the bridge, nothing moves. Result: blank, blank, blank, 5.\\nAlternatively, if the dice were removed in the order 1 then 3, there are still dice in the central part, so the 5 would slide over to the empty spot.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a 3 player solo.  In the random start-up, the player order is red, yellow, and green.\\n\\nInitial Board\\nInitial Setup:\\nGardens:\\nOrange:  A free white die action (well x2, iron + lantern, 2 resources) and pay 3 coins for a courtier action.\\nBlack:  2 resources or a personal domain action.\\nWhite:  2 Daimyo seals or a free die roll action of any color.\\nCastle:\\nSteward level offers double black actions (1 rice + 1 mother of pearl and 1 iron + lantern action); a double orange action (1 seal + 1 influence and 1 rice + 1 lantern action); and a double white die action (1 iron + a lantern action and 2 resources)\\nDiplomat level offers double influence actions or warrior or courtier.  This is going to limit the advantage of promoting courtiers to this level, I believe.  I considered redrawing one of this and elected to play it as it lies.\\nDaimyo level:  lantern or 2 rice or 2 clan points.\\nTraining Grounds:\\n5 iron:  3 rice and any black die action (as above or courtier or 1 Daimyo seal + courtier or 1 Daimyo seal + gardener action.\\n3 iron:  choice of any courtier, warrior, or gardener action.  This will make me reread the rules about an “endless guard loop” discussed at length on the BGG rules forum, though I doubt any player will have enough iron to execute this more than once.  I think this is the most powerful placement for samurai.\\n1 iron:  a white die action, which adds a trip to the well in addition to the white die options mentioned above.\\n\\nStarting Resources and Action Choices\\nGreen has the first choice of the starting cards and selects the first set because it offers a good number of resources, plus the gardener action card.  I think gardener actions ultimately control the game; however, I’ll have to see how this plays out.\\nYellow chooses the second of the remaining cards.  Even though it only offers 3 immediate resources, it has the only courtier start card, and there is a dearth of these options on the board itself.  This could be an opening mistake – we’ll see.\\nRed chooses the remaining right-hand option because it has more resources.  Red’s stuck with the guard action, as it’s the only action card available.\\nTurn 1, round 1:\\nRed chooses an orange 6 in the first steward castle box, gaining 3 coins, a Daimyo seal and a guard action, then pays 2 iron and 2 seals to place a samurai in the 3 training compound.  Then chooses the gardener action to place a meeple below the black bridge, paying 3 food, and then paying 4 coins and 1 Daimyo seal to perform a free action in the personal domain.  Another gardener goes below the black bridge for 1 rice, and Red gains two commodities, in this case, two mother of pearl to prepare for a future courtier action.  This is a powerful, cascading opening move!\\nYellow has no food which limits options immediately.  I think it’s important to get meeples on the board as soon as possible, and the only choice is to play the orange 6 in the castle (Diplomat level), gaining 2 coins and a warrior action.  Yellow spends one iron to gain a free white die action in the castle, choosing to take 2 food in preparation for a gardener action later.  Yellow could have done the same thing by placing a die atop the one red played, gaining a Daimyo seal; however, it was slightly more profitable to take the 2 coins.\\nGreen plays a black 4 to the rightmost steward area of the castle, gaining 1 coin and a gardener action, then paying 2 food to place below the orange bridge, then gaining a food and MoP with the free white die action, prepping for a courtier action in the next round.\\nTurn 1, round 2:\\nRed only has 2 mother of pearl and 2 coins, so this turn will not be as lucrative as the first one.  Red places a white d5 outside the walls and pays the 2 coins to place a courtier at the gate.  The mother of pearl can move the courtier in round 3.\\nYellow plays a white d5 in the personal domain, paying 1 coin, gaining 3 mother of pearl (MoP hereafter)  and sending a courtier to the gate for another 2 coins.\\nGreen plays the black d2 to the middle steward slot, paying 1 coin, gaining a D-seal, and moving the courtier to the rightmost steward level and claiming the card which allows retention of the gardener option.  Green chooses the first light colored action as the bonus, gaining 1 iron and the lantern action, which awards 1 rice and a trip to the well for a D-seal, MoP, and 1 rice.\\nThe new card has 2 white die options (2 clan points or -1 D-seal for a warrior action).\\nTurn 1, round 3:\\nRed is strapped for options, with 4 d1s, a d2, and a d4 on the bridges, and no coins to spend to place a meeple in the castle or the outer countryside. The orange d4 to the well gives a D-seal, 3 coins, 1 MoP, and 1 iron.  After a commendable first round, Red is slowing down to regroup.\\nYellow now has the same die-dilemma Red faced, but the d4 is gone.  The best move is to place a black die in the castle (middle steward) for a cost of no coins, pay a D-seal and 2 coins to put a courtier at the gate.  With 5 MoP, a possible two level jump is in the future.  The removal of that die also prevents Red from getting an end-of-round bonus from the black bridge.\\nGreen:  Green can go for either a warrior action and a following gardener action or a courtier action.  At this point in the game, it seems more important to get meeples on the board.  Green plays a black d2 outside the castle walls (-2 coins and 1 D-seal) (also removes a Red bonus) and places a samurai for 3 iron, gaining a gardener action, paying 2 rice to claim the lowest bridge action to gain 2 D-seals.\\nEnd-of-Turn bonuses:  Green gets a free white die action, choosing to move Influence 2 bumps in order to become the first player.  Red is blocked from any bonuses, and yellow has failed to place any gardeners.  This, I believe, puts Yellow at a huge disadvantage.\\nGoing into the second epoch, here is the board.\\n\\nTurn 2, round 1:\\nNote:\\nI have to assume the player cards are correct; the cat got to the pieces a bit even though I’d put a plexiglass sheet over the game when I went out to run errands.  Red may be short a food, but in reviewing my text, I think I got it right.\\nRerolls on all  dice:  Orange (2-5-6-6); Black (1-4-5-5); White (2-2-2-5)\\nGreen:  Green plays the black d5 to the first steward level to gain 2 coins and one of each resource, plus a lantern action for another food and 1 influence.  My other option was to play an orange d6 in my personal domain for 2 food, an iron, and a lantern.  That seemed slightly less effective.  I wish I’d had the resources to do what Red did in the opener.\\nRed:  Plays black d5 to the middle steward for 2 coins, and then pays a D-seal for a courtier action to advance from the gate to claim the same card.  The free action grants 2 rice and 1 influence from the combo of card and lantern. That choice ensures a later courtier action.  The replacement card gives 2 resources for a black die or a MoP, lantern, and warrior action from the doubled red dice.\\nYellow:  Kind of a quandary here.  Yellow needs to place a gardener, but also needs to advance a courtier.  Unfortunately, I have no D-seals to spend, so I’m looking for something to get both resources and one of the aforementioned meeple placements.  I play a white d5 to my personal domain to gain 2 MoP, and then pay 2 MoP to advance to the steward level of the castle, leftmost area.  The card gives me 2 iron, a D-seal, and an influence.  The influence puts me second in the move order.  The new card offers red die 1 D-seal and 1 resource, and the double blacks for a courtier action, 1 iron, and 1 food.  Still no gardeners!\\nTurn 2, round 2\\nGreen:  It really is a bother having doubled cranes in the diplomatic level of the castle.  There are much better cards in the deck, ones that haven’t turned yet.  This limits my options.  I play the orange d6 atop the black d5 in the middle steward level to gain a MoP, 1 coin, and a lantern (1 food; 1 influence) and pay one D-seal for a warrior action.  I convert 4 D-seals to iron and spend my remaining iron to place a warrior in the 3-iron area, gaining a gardener action, to place a meeple below the black bridge, paying 1 food and gaining 2 resources, 2 food in this case.  This gives me the resources to place another meeple below the black bridge…I think… on the next round.\\nYellow:  I have only two meeples on the board, so that puts me seriously behind, and I doubt I’ll be able to catch up.  I have the most MoP, so a castle action will take me to the Daimyo level of the fortress.  But that doesn’t get another meeple on the board.  Otherwise, I’m short on resources and coins, which makes a trip to the well a good choice.  The other option is to promote my courtier and claim 2 food or a lantern.  I think I need to do the well.  I play an orange d6 to the well to gain 5 coins, a D-seal, 1 MoP, and 1 food.\\nRed:  I play the orange d5 outside the walls to place a gardener below the orange bridge for 2 food.  The free light-background action grants me 1 MoP and a lantern (1 food; 1 influence, to move me to 2nd in the turn order for the next round).\\nTurn 2, round 3:\\nGreen:  My plan to get a gardener on the right side of the black bridge falls 1 coin short.  My best choice is to play the black d4 to the rightmost steward level of the castle to gain 1 coin, a D-seal, and a food.  This gives me a few better choices heading into the final turns.\\nRed:  There are only d2’s left on the bridges, so whatever I do will cost coins (except for the well).  I can play a white d2 to the outer walls and gain a castle action (for 3 coins), pay 2 coins to advance my influence to gain first player, or play the orange d2 for nebulous rewards.  I play for the courtier action, paying 3 coins and move my courtier from the gate to the middle steward level to claim the card and 2 iron.  The new card grants double red (1 D-seal, 1 clan point, and -1 D-seal for a gardener action).  Playing from the left side of the bridge also gives me a lantern for a food, a coin, and an influence.\\nYellow:  I play a white d2 outside the walls at the cost of no coins to perform a courtier action.  The lanterns gives me a D-seal, an iron, and an influence.  I pay 5 MoP to jump to the Daimyo level and claim another lantern.  The influence gain means I’ll move second in the next round.\\nGreen gains bridge bonuses 1 food and 1 iron, and pays a D-seal to jump 2 influence and move into the 3 Victory Point (Clan Points) area.  Red gains 2 iron and also pays a D-seal to jump 2 influence, stealing Yellow’s hard-earned second move spot.\\n\\nEnd of the Second Round\\nTurn 3, round 1:\\nRerolls:  Orange (1-2-5-5); Black (4-5-6-6); White (2-4-4-5)\\nGreen:  I’d like to do the 3-iron military action to get another warrior on the board for the warrior-courtier bonus at game end, but I haven’t the iron.  In place of that, I’d like to play on my home board, but I haven’t the D-seal needed for the garden action.  If I’d thought ahead, I wouldn’t have spent that D-seal earlier to move my influence.  No matter what, I’m one “something” short of doing what I really desire, so I have to settle for a white d5 to my personal domain. This give me 3 MoP for a later courtier action (which I may not need) and 2 iron, which I desperately need for the next round, at a cost of 1 coin.  AARRRGGG!  I just realized I’m still short a Daimyo seal!\\nRed:  Short of resources, I play a black d6 to the well for 5 coins, a D-seal, 1 MoP, and 1 food.  This sets me up for a garden action next turn.  I really need two more food, but that’s not going to happen.\\nYellow: Still sucking for meeples on the board, so there’s absolutely no way I can win this.  My best bet is to do my best and try to limit others’ options, if that is even possible.  I play an orange d5 to my personal domain to gain 2 food, then spend a D-seal to perform a guard action for 3 iron.  I take a garden action to place a meeple below the orange bridge for 2 food; my free action is to spend a D-seal and move 2 influence, using a white-background double crane.  At least that gives me 6 VP at game end. (3 and 3 for the two placements)  I’m also second player in the next round, for what good it does.  Feeling pretty defeated about now.\\nTurn 3, round 2\\nGreen:  Huzzah!  I didn’t need the D-seal after all!  I play a black d6 outside the castle walls to perform a warrior action, placing a third samurai in the 3-iron training ground.  I choose the gardener action, placing a meeple below the white bridge for 5 food, then paying 4 coins for any die action in the castle.  I take a D-seal and 1 MoP, maxing out the latter and leaving my coins, food, and iron at zero.\\nYellow:  I have one of each resource and one coin.  Best bet is to play the black d5 outside the walls for a garden action, placing a meeple in the one slot below the black bridge.    I collect 2 food for the next turn.  My only option for clan points is in the final white bridge space.\\nRed:  The best I can do this round is plan for the final round.  Despite my early lead, I think Green has surpassed me, though I haven’t counted any clan points.  Ideally, if I could get 4 MoP, I could get a courtier to the Daimyo level; however, there’s no way on this board to do that.  If I can get 2 food and 1 MoP, I can pick up 10 more clan points.  Aha!  I think I can do that if I visit the well.  I don’t need money, as I have 8 coins, so I can choose a low die for a lantern action.  I place a black d4 at the well for 3 coins, a D-seal, 1 MoP, and 1 food.  The lantern gives me the fourth food I need, moves me to first player in case of a tie-breaker, and gives me another coin.\\nTurn 3, round 3, FINAL\\nGreen:  The best I can do is place the orange d5 outside the castle walls, atop the black d5 for a courtier action.  I pay 5 MoP to jump my courtier to the Daimyo level to claim 2 clan points and a lantern action.  The lantern gives me a (worthless) food and the influence puts me in the lead for a tie-breaker.\\nYellow:  My only options for clan points are a move to the gate (not enough coins), a move to the gardens (not enough food), or a move to the training grounds (I have 1 iron).  The last will give me one clan point.  I play a white d4 to the rightmost steward room, collect 2 clan points, and pay my last D-seal to place a warrior in the 1-iron training ground.  The white die option moves my influence two bumps.\\nRed:  I play the orange d1 to the middle steward room, paying two coins to gain a D-seal, 1 clan point, and pay the D-seal for a garden action.  My final gardener occupies the orange bridge for 4 food, and the courtier action (3 coins) promotes 1 meeple to the next level.  I claim a card, and the free action moves my influence marker to the head of the pack.    There’s no reason to replace the card because that move ended the game.\\nGame Tallies:\\nDaimyo seals and coins\\n:  Red +2; Green 0:  Yellow 0\\nResources:\\nRed +3 (iron); Green 0; Yellow 0\\nPassage of Time:\\nall +3\\nClan members in Castle\\n:  Red +9; Green +10; Yellow +10\\nIn the Training Yards:\\nRed +2; Green +3; Yellow +3\\nIn the Gardens:\\nRed +25; Green +16; Yellow +4\\nFinal Result\\nRed 45 clan points:  WINNER\\nGreen 34\\nYellow 22\\nBased on this playing, the game is won in the gardens, augmented by the number of cascading plays one can make through the progress of the game.  Red got a huge jump with the cascade on the very first round, and then capitalized by claiming all three high-point bridge spots by game’s end.  Green suffered from resource management and played too much in the Training Grounds, not having the food or coins to follow in Red’s footsteps.  Yellow was resource handicapped throughout, not getting into the meeple game until late.  Here\\'s the board at game end:\\n\\nSent you private message.\\n\\nThis is a neat session report.

Nine of them were rules as written and one was using the Gingkogawa variant.\\n47-52 (L); Medium difficulty\\n58-44 (W); Medium\\n78-91 (L); Medium (only time I\\'ve managed to place all 15 clan members and my highest score to this point)\\n66-62 (W); Medium\\n61-64 (L); Medium\\n73-56 (W); Medium\\n44-34 (W); Medium\\n52-43 (W); Gingkogawa Clan on normal - same exact setup as previous game\\n52-68 (L); Hard\\n102-65 (W); Hard (First time I broke 100 and first time I made it all the way to the last section of the Passage of Time track - scoring me 12 points)\\nI had seven solo plays last year; I don\\'t remember all the scores but I was 4-1 on Easy and 1-1 on Medium difficulties. So, in total my W-L record per difficulty for the rules as written is as follows: 4-1 Easy, 5-4 Medium, 1-1 Hard. I think this is a pretty good balance. So, I can understand if there is criticism that the bot is swingy and does note react to the game state with regards to the available combos that can trigger but I don\\'t personally agree with the claims that the solo bot is too difficult to beat and not enjoyable with the rules as written.\\n\\nMost everyone who mentioned the difficulty on BGG seemed to be talking about the Easy difficulty, which is (unintentionally?) harder than Medium.  I suppose it is impossible any rules were overlooked in your 4-1 Easy record?  I\\'m also curious about the scores there.\\n*edit*  To be more specific, this thread mentioned the Easy difficulty regularly scoring 70+ points, which is surprising to me given the scores you report for harder difficulties:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3169770/easier-solitaire-mo...\\nAnother thread mentioned Easy difficulty consistently scoring 87-95!\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3168298/automa-way-too-stro...\\nAre these players missing rules?  Are we missing rules?  Is the variability just that high?  It is hard to say without more data.\\nEven Isra, the designer, mentioned they usually win only 1 out of every 6-7 games.  I\\'m not sure if that was referring to Easy difficulty or not.\\nThis post suggests some commonly missed rules which may make the automa score too low:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3168298/article/43147100#43...\\nAnd finally, the post after that suggests going first on Easy difficulty may be a disadvantage, and makes the automa harder.\\n\\nIt\\'s funny but looking back at the frequently overlooked rules made me realize that I missed a rule for Automa scoring over these past ten games. The rule about the automa scoring points equal to the round number for actions they can\\'t take. But I do remember doing that for the games I played last year. (I put the game away for a while and then came back to is earlier this month). I did look through some pictures on my phone to find the Easy difficulty scores I had. This is without any rules misses. After my first game when I won handily I actually reread the rulebook and rewatched One Stop Co-Op Shop\\'s playthrough to make sure I hadn\\'t missed any rules.\\n78-52 (W)\\n57-56 (W)\\n41-68 (L)\\n72-51 (W)\\n76-63 (W)\\nI actually prefer to go first as there is often some combo I want to make sure I get and don\\'t want to risk the automa taking from me. And in my games the automa scored a lot of points from turning in coins; so, having the exchange rate be 5/point rather than 3/point cost them quite a few points by game end.\\n\\nInteresting, that\\'s very consistently around the 50-60 range.  It is so hard to believe some of the posts mentioning 80-90 or higher for Easy automa scores, unless there is some other factor going on.\\n\\nInteresting, that\\'s very consistently around the 50-60 range.  It is so hard to believe some of the posts mentioning 80-90 or higher for Easy automa scores, unless there is some other factor going on.\\n\\nYeah, I can see that maybe happening in one or two games with particularly bad card pulls and almost all double-actions for the AI. But that shouldn\\'t be consistently happening, in my experience.\\nAnyway, my goal was to generate a little discussion but to also provide some empirical data from one man\\'s solo experiences with the game for anyone contemplating whether or not they\\'d like to add this to their collection. This was my #3 game of the year for 2023 and I absolutely love it. I don\\'t think anyone should be scared away from the game because they think it might be frustratingly unwinnable when playing solo. Ultimately, opinions are subjective but if you\\'re drawn to the game for its theme/setting/art and enjoy dice/worker placement and combos I think it\\'s a worthy addition to any collection.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs the only way to gain influence by paying one Daimyo Seal per bump and/or the bird icon?  (Plus the extra seal to cross the line)\\nDoes this payment only occur on your turn?  Or can it be done anytime?\\n\\nYou can not randomly pay seals to get influence. There is no such rule. You get influence every time you activate an action with a \"crane\" icon. That icon appears on some cards and samurai tokens. The icon is also added to your lantern bonus after first courtier goes to a room, because starting yellow cards always have a \"crane\" on the backside.\\nYou need to get \"crane\" action AND pay damyo seal(s) to cross the thresholds on influence track.\\n\\nYou don\\'t pay seals for influence; you only have to pay seals when crossing a line. You get influence for bird icons.\\n\\nFor example, if this was your tableau you would gain one space on the influence track for every lantern action you took.\\n\\nAn expenditure of seals may be required to make the jump from one section of the track to the next. E.G. here it would cost red two to make the jump.\\n\\nThank you.  The bit about paying to move up the Influence track (at will) did not seem right to me, and now I\\'m stymied trying to find the rule I misinterpreted.  Your clarifications and examples have put my mind at ease.  Thanks again, Gents.\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring our play today we came up to the following situation:\\nAt the end of the first/second round there was a die left on the bridge and therefore the gardeners under that bridge were activated again. The gardener\\'s field showed the \"place a gardener action\". So the question was: If I place the new gardener on a field, where again is a die left on the corresponding bridge, can I activate this gardener again aswell (so two times in summary = first time by placing and second time by the leftover die)?\\nI couldn\\'t find a sentence in the rule, that answered this, so I hope you can help me there and you understood, what I was trying to say\\n\\nYour question is pretty clear\\nthey will activate only once, see\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3176664/article/43160670\\n\\nThank you very much, I didnt found that thread when I tried to find an answer for my question!\\ncheers!\\n\\n\\n\\nCan you stack dice on the 5 dice space where you activate the 3 main actions?\\n\\nCan you stack dice on the 5 dice space where you activate the 3 main actions?\\n\\nYes, except in a 1-2 player game and only one die may be stacked per space. See page 5 of the Rulebook.\\n\\nThanks Peter....\\n\\nHope you’re enjoying this great little game…\\n\\n2 dice only can be stacked; if you\\'re playing 2 players, no dice stacking at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is this a variant?\\nThe rules for White Castle says to use three dice of each colour  for two players.\\n\\nMe and my hubby love to play White Castle with three dice in each color instead of two.   Makes the game a bit longer and gives you a bit more to do.  Give it a try and let me know what you think! Thanks\\n\\nReread the rules. Two players requires three dice of each color! You were playing it wrong…\\nBut I’m very happy you’re enjoying this great game!\\n\\nI suppose they say they take 4 turns instead of 3 each round. That\\'s a common idea for all new players, I\\'ve been there to, and there are at least two similar threads here. All though it has two issues:\\n1) the choice of last dice is extremely limited. That\\'s why you put (players number + 1) dice on each bridge: the turns must give you options\\n2) the game was designed to be tight, crisysy (is that a word lol) and short. To make it longer you can try making it deeper and find longer combos rather than making more turns with less turn efficiency.\\nSo try to find elegant turns where you put out three different meeples and you will see the core idea of this game: combos\\n\\nOK - I give up  what is\\ncrisysy\\n(is that a word lol)\\n\\nOK - I give up  what is\\ncrisysy\\n(is that a word lol)\\n\\nThe kind of game with a lot of crisis\\n\\nOK - I give up  what is\\ncrisysy\\n(is that a word lol)\\n\\nThe kind of game with a lot of crisis\\n\\nI think “tight” and “tense” might be the better words for this game…\\n\\nOK - I give up  what is\\ncrisysy\\n(is that a word lol)\\n\\nThe kind of game with a lot of crisis\\n\\nI think “tight” and “tense” might be the better words for this game…\\n\\nThank you sir, English is my second language\\n\\nOK - I give up  what is\\ncrisysy\\n(is that a word lol)\\n\\nThe kind of game with a lot of crisis\\n\\nI think “tight” and “tense” might be the better words for this game…\\n\\nThank you sir, English is my second language\\n\\nAlso, the plural of \"crisis\" is \"crises\".

It was on the demo tables at Devir and the interest there was so great that I walked past it knowing that the Dutch edition of 999 Games was already in the shops at home.\\nThe White Castle fits seamlessly into a list of popular Japanese-themed Euro worker placement games of the last few years: Bitoku, Iki, Gugong. It is played in the same kind of fantasy world and if you want to get in the right mood you must read what the makers want to tell you:\\nThe heron flies over the Himeji sky while the Daimio watches every movement of his servants from the top of his castle. Gardeners tend to the pond, where the koi carp live, warriors stand guard on the walls and courtiers crowd at the gates, yearning for an audience that brings them closer to the inner circles of the court. When night falls, the lanterns are lit and the workers return to their clan.\\nFlowery language. Including nice pictures. I really, really like all that!\\nThese authors are Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero. The duo is better known under the stage name Llama Dice and they have designed the successful The Red Cathedral together with Devir.\\nAt The White Castle, we leave Ivan the Terrible’s Moscow behind us to explore modern Japan\\'s most imposing fortress, Himeji Castle. Here flies the flag of the Sakai clan, commanded by Daimio Sakai Tadakiyo.\\nThe White Castle is a Euro-like game with resource management mechanisms, worker placement, and dice placement to perform actions. During the game, over the course of three rounds (in which you only have 9 turns, 3 times per round), players send members of their clan to tend the gardens, defend the castle or move up the social ladder of the nobility. At the end of the game, players are awarded victory points in a variety of ways.\\nThe first thing you notice is that the box in which the game comes is much smaller than similar games of this category. It\\'s the size of a Carcassonne box, which would almost give you the impression that The White Castle is a game of the same quality/difficulty. And that is not the case. You get a lot more for your thirty euros (which is a real bargain).\\nOnce the box is open, you notice that there is no insert and that all the space is filled with ... the game. And that\\'s darn clever! The box is chock-full (as I write this I wonder where the expression \"chock\" comes from - I\\'ll have to look that up in a minute).\\nSo it\\'s a small box, but the game board has a normal size. It\\'s just made up of more panels. It is clearly laid out and does not look too cluttered. I like that because I often let myself be thrown off when a game board looks like a painting by Hieronymus Bosch.\\nOn the central panel of the game board is Himeji Castle. It is divided into several zones. Most of the playing field is in the castle itself, with the Chamber of a Thousand Carpets, which the courtiers must work their way up in three steps until they reach the circle closest to the Daimio. There they are within his sphere of influence and that is the highest reward. There are also the pond and gardens, meticulously maintained and groomed by the gardeners. Here, everyone can relax and contemplate the beauty of the surroundings without limits. Another important area is the wall and exterior of the castle, where the warriors patrol and keep watch.\\nFinally, there’s the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice that can be used to perform actions are collected. Those cardboard bridges are a rather superfluous addition to the game. It gives me an Everdell-itch ...\\nNext to the large game board is the personal domain of each player; the place where they store their resources and where they have access to their fifteen workers.\\nThe game is played in three rounds - which are three years, it says in the rulebook. A jigsawed figurine of a ferocious koi carp serves as a round marker - which I also consider to be a bit over the top.\\nIn those three rounds, each player has three turns. So you will only get your turn nine times in total. That\\'s not a lot. Especially when a game lasts more than two hours. In each turn, you only have two (sometimes three) actions. And that\\'s not an awful lot either.\\nSo, what is it that takes up so much time in the game?\\nProcessing the consequences of the actions and their effects on the number of resources takes time. Keeping score takes time. Each turn lasts more than three minutes, so you have to wait some ten minutes (in a game with four players) before it is your turn again.\\nThat\\'s a long time when you\\'re an impatient person – like me. Yet, strangely enough, that didn\\'t bother me at all in The White Castle. That’s probably because  during other people\\'s turns enough changes, which also has consequences for your strategy. In short, you must stay with it. Despite my ADD, I was fascinated enough not to be distracted. A big plus!\\nWhat did I think of it?\\nFascinating. But I have already said that. I found it truly fascinating. The White Castle is one of those games that nicely incorporates its theme in its mechanics. The gameplays is captivating. It\\'s not excessively different from other Euros, but still, there\\'s no other game like The White Castle - I don\\'t know how else to describe it.\\nMoreover, there are two things that I usually really appreciate in a game:\\n- Only after final scoring we know who won the game.\\n- There is hardly any luck involved.\\nIf such is the case, a game always get an extra point: 8/10.\\nI would sure like to play it again.\\n\\nReview for Bordspelwereld by: Dick  (MetDick),\\nPublished on 13-10-2023, with a rating of 8/10 stars\\nLink to review:\\nhttps://www.bordspelwereld.nl/en/en-reviews/the-white-castle\\n\\nThe White Castle fits effortlessly into a list of popular\\nJapanese\\n-themed euro worker placement games from the last few years: Bitoku, Iki,\\nGugong\\n. It is played in the same kind\\n\\nMinor quibble, but Gugong is set in China. The distance from Paris to Amsterdam is 430 km*; the distance from Beijing to Tokyo is 2092.3 km. I say this not to just share an obscure fact, but to show it would actually be more reasonable for a Chinese person to dismiss the cultural distinction between the Dutch and French, given their proxy, than for a European to conflate these Asian cultures. I assume you\\'d be shocked to be lumped in with French cultural things, and even moreso to be lumped into a culture nearly 5x the distance of Paris from XXX.\\n* flying.\\n\\nThat\\'s not a foal either.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what you mean by this.\\nIn English, a foal is a baby horse.\\n\\nThat\\'s not a foal either.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what you mean by this.\\nIn English, a foal is a baby horse.\\n\\nLikely a typo. \"Foul\" would be my guess. i.e. \"the limited actions are worth mentioning, but I\\'m not dinging the game by citing this.\" (alternative read of that passage).\\n\\nThat\\'s not a foal either.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what you mean by this.\\nIn English, a foal is a baby horse.\\n\\nLikely a typo. \"Foul\" would be my guess. i.e. \"the limited actions are worth mentioning, but I\\'m not dinging the game by citing this.\" (alternative read of that passage).\\n\\nYes that looks reasonable. I thought it might have been a typo, but given their likely first language is not English, I was thinking it could be a mistranslation which would broaden the possibilities considerably. And I just wasn\\'t sure. Hence the question.\\n\\nHaha! Sorry about that. We’ve corrected that (really peculiar) translation error.\\n\\nCan’t argue with that!\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t usually use my starting action card. To use it, I\\'d have to, before getting a courtier into the palace, use a 6 (or 5 + a coin, or....) to take that action and gain one resource. At that early stage of the game, it doesn\\'t seem like the best use of a 6.\\nSo when I\\'m looking at the starting card pairs, I look at the starting resources (in the context of the starting board) rather than the starting action.\\nBut I haven\\'t played often or well, so I might well be missing something...\\n\\nI\\'ve not used it alone except when I had a gardener and it had some benefit.  However, the dice were with me.\\nHowever, I\\'ve not played that many games either, and I do not score very well either\\n\\nIf it’s a two-player solo game, you might otherwise be blocked from taking that particular action by your and/or  your opponent’s two placed dice Outside the Walls. So you can do other non-courtier actions first (so the action card isn’t replaced) and then save it for your third turn of the first round, assuming you have collected and retained the necessary resources to perform the action and have enough coins for the remaining die differential. That also allows you to plan ahead to get those resources and coins on your first two turns.\\n\\nThe startling card is hugely important during the first round where it can be activated from any row,  hence comboing nicely. The optimal time when it has to be replaced through a courtier action is one of most decisive moment in the game. E.g a gardener or a warrior power might give you the activation of the whole row in which case I would keep it a bit longer (and deploying that gardener or warrior  in round 1).\\n\\n@Michele\\nSo what you are saying is that basically you don’t go to the Castle with a courtier until later, when you might have activated several places in the warrior or gardener? ( since the courier) would cause a card replacement)\\nI only played a couple of games… so just asking about your experience\\nThanks\\n\\nIt is the only time in the game where your personal domain action can have the correct resource aligned with its associated action (none of the castle cards have the action in the row with its associated resource). It\\'s particularly relevant if you start with the Warrior action - placing a Gardener or two unlocks easy Warrior actions via the middle row, especially if the personal domain Garden action is in the game (which is also the cheapest of the \"chainable\" Garden actions i.e. easiest to do on turn 1). In that situation, I\\'ve found it lucrative to even avoid Courting in the first round (which would replace the card) and get multiple Warriors out quickly while also getting Garden bonuses/points early. Extra appealing if the 3 Metal action (or 5, depending how much Metal you have available) gives access to the Garden.\\n\\nIt is the only time in the game where your personal domain action can have the correct resource aligned with its associated action (none of the castle cards have the action in the row with its associated resource).

Het lag bij Devir op de demotafels en de belangstelling was daar zo groot dat ik er voorbij ben gelopen wetende dat de Nederlandse uitgave van 999 Games thuis al in de winkels lag.\\nThe White Castle (of Het Witte Kasteel) past moeiteloos in een rijtje populaire euro-workerplacementspellen met een Japans thema van de laatste jaren: Bitoku, Iki, Gugong. Het wordt gespeeld in een zelfde soort fantasiewereld en wanneer je in de juiste stemming wilt komen moet je vooral lezen wat de makers je willen vertellen:\\nDe reiger vliegt over de Himeji-hemel terwijl de Daimio vanaf de top van het kasteel zijn dienaren ziet bewegen. Tuinmannen verzorgen de vijver, waar de koikarpers leven, krijgers houden de wacht op de muren en hovelingen verdringen zich bij de poorten, smachtend naar een publiek dat hen dichter bij de binnenste kringen van het hof brengt. Als de avond valt, worden de lantaarns aangestoken en keren de arbeiders terug naar hun clan.\\nBloemrijke taal, breed en met plaatjes. Ik lust daar wel pap van, mense!\\nDeze auteurs zijn Sheila Santos en Israel Cendrero. Het duo is meer bekend onder de artiestennaam Llama Dice en heeft samen met Devir ook de succesvolle The Red Cathedral ontworpen.\\nIn The White Castle laten we het Moskou van Ivan de Verschrikkelijke achter ons om het meest imposante fort van het moderne Japan, Himeji Castle, te verkennen. Hier wappert de vlag van de Sakai-clan onder bevel van Daimio Sakai Tadakiyo.\\nThe White Castle is een Euro-achtig spel met mechanismen voor grondstoffenbeheer, plaatsing van werknemers en plaatsing van dobbelstenen om acties uit te voeren. Tijdens het spel, gedurende drie rondes (waarin je slechts 9 maal aan de beurt bent, 3 x per ronde), sturen spelers leden van hun clan om de tuinen te onderhouden, het kasteel te verdedigen of hogerop te komen op de sociale ladder van de adel. Aan het einde van de wedstrijd worden spelers op verschillende manieren overwinningspunten toegekend.\\nAls eerste valt op dat de doos waarin het spel zit veel kleiner is dan vergelijkbare spellen van deze categorie. Het heeft het formaat van een Carcassonnedoos, waardoor je bijna de indruk zou krijgen dat The White Castle een spel van eenzelfde kwaliteit/moeilijkheidsgraad is. En dat is dus niet zo. Je krijgt veel meer voor je dertig euro (wat een koopje is).\\nWanneer de doos eenmaal open is valt op dat er geen inlay is en dat alle ruimte wordt gevuld met spel. En dat is verdomd knap! Het doosje zit tjokvol (terwijl ik dit schrijf vraag ik me af waar de uitdrukking \"tjok\" eigenlijk vandaan komt - ik moet dat zo even opzoeken).\\nEen klein doosje dus maar het speelbord heeft een normaal formaat. Het bestaat gewoon uit meer panelen. Het is overzichtelijk ingedeeld en ziet er ook niet al te druk uit. Ik vind dat prettig want ik laat me nogal eens van de wijs brengen wanneer een speelbord lijkt op een schilderij van Jeroen Bosch.\\nOp het middenpaneel van het speelbord ligt kasteel Himeji. Het is verdeeld in verschillende zones. De grootste deel van het speelveld ligt in het kasteel zelf, met de Kamer van de Duizend Tapijten, waar de hovelingen zich in drie stappen op moeten werken totdat ze de cirkel bereiken die het dichtst bij de Daimio ligt. Daar zijn ze binnen zijn invloedssfeer en dat wordt het hoogst beloond. Er zijn ook de vijver en de tuinen, minutieus bijgehouden en gegroomd door de tuinmannen. Hier kan iedereen onbeperkt ontspannen en de schoonheid ervan aanschouwen. Een ander belangrijk gebied is de muur en de buitenkant van het kasteel, waar de krijgers patrouilleren en de wacht houden.\\nTen slotte vinden we het gebied van de drie bruggen, waar de drie soorten dobbelstenen die kunnen worden gebruikt om acties uit te voeren, worden verzameld. Die kartonnen bruggen zijn een tamelijk overbodige toevoeging in het spel. Ik krijg er Everdelljeuk van.\\nNaast het grote speelbord ligt nog het persoonlijke domein van elke speler, het deel waar ze hun hulpbronnen op bewaren en waar ze de beschikking hebben over hun vijftien arbeiders.\\nHet spel wordt gespeeld in drie ronden - jaren volgens de spelregels. Als rondemarker is er een woeste koikarper gefiguurzaagd - ook een beetje over de top.\\nIn die drie rondes heeft elke speler drie beurten. Je komt - in totaal - dus maar negen maal aan de beurt. Dat is nogal weinig. Zeker wanneer een spel ruim twee uur duurt. In elke beurt heb je slechts twee (soms drie) acties. Da\\'s ook nie veul.\\nWat is er dan dat zo veel tijd kost in het spel?\\nHet verwerken van de gevolgen van de acties en het effect hiervan op de grondstoffenadministratie en de puntentellingen neemt tijd in beslag. Elke beurt duurt ruim drie minuten en je moet (in een spel met vier spelers) dus telkens tien minuten wachten voor je opnieuw aan de beurt bent.\\nDat is lang wanneer je een ongeduldig tiep bent - zoals ik. Maar toch heb ik me daar, wonderlijk genoeg, in The White Castle helemaal niet aan gestoord. Waarschijnlijk omdat er tijdens de beurten van anderen genoeg verandert dat ook gevolgen heeft voor jouw strategie. Je moet er - kortom - dus wel een beetje bij blijven. Mij boeide het - ondanks mijn ADD component - voldoende om niet afgeleid te worden. Een dikke plus!\\nWat vond ik er van?\\nBoeiend. Maar dat heb ik dus al gezegd. Ik vond het boeiend. The White Castle is een spel waarvan het thema mooi in het mechaniek zit en waarvan het spel boeit. Het is niet buitensporig veel anders dan andere Euro\\'s maar toch is er geen ander spel als The White Castle - ik weet ook niet hoe ik het anders moet omschrijven: het boeit.\\nWat ik wel prettig vind is dat er twee dingen zijn die ik doorgaans erg waardeer:\\nDe winnaar van het spel is pas bekend na de laatste puntentelling - aan het eind van het spel.\\nEr is nauwelijks sprake van geluk.\\nIn zo\\'n geval, met die plussen, verdient een spel bij mij altijd een extra puntje: 8/10 en ik speel het graag opnieuw.\\n\\nReview voor Bordspelwereld door: Dick  (MetDick),\\nEerder geplaatst op: 13-10-2023, met een waardering van: 8/10 sterren\\nhttps://www.bordspelwereld.nl/nl/reviews-nl/nieuwste-reviews...\\n\\n\\n\\nTWC is sometimes described as a game that’s over too soon. Our game was not over soon. I did emphasize that you get just nine turns in the whole game, and everyone realized that meant you can;t waste a turn. We were at the maximum player count of four. The early turns can take a while as people work out what the just-explained rules mean in terms of doing well. The later turns can take a while, as people earn resources more quickly and can chain actions on the same turn. There can be sometimes a “No, I don’t want to do that, let me unwind and start again” turn.\\nThat\\'s a quote from\\n\\nmy account of today\\'s teach and play of TWC.\\n\\n, sandwiched between Syrian food, a burger, and praise for the city of Providence, Rhode Island.\\nI\\'m glad to have brought three new players into the Castle, although I\\'m not surprised to see 3 and 2 considered better player counts than 4.\\n\\nAgreed, it’s a fast(ish) game and 4p doesn’t flow quite as smoothly.\\n\\n\\n\\nHi all,\\nMy wife and I are enjoying the white castle, but we\\'re always left with the feeling that it finished when it was really starting... We always finish the game with circa 30vp and just 4-5 meeple placed in total.\\nSo, when I finish the game, instead of thinking how good it was, i immediately start thinking how good could\\'ve been if it was slightly longer.\\nI was wondering if there are ways to extend the experience and make it longer... Maybe changing the end of the game from the fixed 3 seasons to counting vp in real time and stopping when someone achieves a target amount. Also, turn order will be much more decisive.\\nI\\'ve also considered included 1 more dice per player\\n\\nHello Oscar,\\nWith 30vp you have just started to explore the scoring potentials - and you surely have to get more meeples out. So before tweaking the game here are some tips:\\n- Plan to get a bonus action that allows you to place another meeple. This may mean that you have to spend a round to collect the necessary resources and only then choose that action.\\n- Have enough resources to make use of the end-of-round bonus action of a gardener.\\n- Don\\'t forget the cubes on your player board. I usually try to have a card there that, when activated, allows me to get a meeple out. Especially in solo this is important as the bot takes away action fields very quickly, and then you have a problem because without meeples on the board your scoring options are limited.\\n- Look for combos: using a die to get out a warrior, which allows you to get out a gardener, which allows you to get out another meeple? Awesome.\\nBut to make use of these combos you need the resources to pay for the warrior, the gardener and the bonus action of the gardener.\\nGardeners are often underestimated. They can provide a good amount of points. The lantern bonus can also be great if you get 2+ VP each time.\\nKeep playing, it\\'s a great game.\\n\\nOr you could try starting by playing a random card from your preferred deck into your lantern, giving you more benefits to start with, plus making your lantern more valuable.\\n\\nIf you’re only placing 4-5 meeples and getting around 30:VPs, you are indeed not implementing a viable strategy. Check out Monique and Naveen’s playthrough video on the BGG site for the game.\\n\\n\\n\\nHi there. We’ve played several times with the wrong rules regarding gardeners. I assumed that when you laid your gardener meeple on a card, it blocked that card for the game - similar to the card in the top level of the castle. But last night I wanted to take the gardener action and all the cards were filled, so I checked the rules and I saw an example photo on page 10 showing two gardeners on a card, and the text stating that only one gardener ‘from each clan’ can go on a single card, not one gardener total!\\nMy confusion comes from the card icon: when a card shows a meeple figure outline, that suggests that you fill it with one meeple and one meeple only - as is the case at the top castle level. But on the gardener case, that doesn’t apply. Seems a bit misleading.\\nI suppose this isn’t really a question, more just a post double-checking that I’ve got it correct, and wondering if anyone else has made this mistake?\\n\\nEach player can only place one gardener at each location. Does not block another player placing a gardener there.\\n\\nHi there. We’ve played several times with the wrong rules regarding gardeners.

However, the limitation is just one gardener per clan. I believe the iconography is to just make clear which of your worker meeples (gardeners) go in those locations. It\\'s a very small detail but the gardener outline on the garden cards are smaller than the courtier outlines on the top castle location card. So, while the courtier \"fills\" that spot (and thus blocks it) the gardener doesn\\'t really fill the garden card - it just denotes who goes there.\\nI believe this is a common misconception, though. When I taught my group the game at least one of them assumed that only one gardener total can go to each location. And when I explained multiple gardeners can be there - just one per clan - there was a big \"oooohhhh that\\'s much better\" moment.\\n\\nI believe this is a common misconception, though.

Blown.\\nThis is a great game with a terrible rule book.\\n\\nThis is a great game with a terrible rule book.\\n\\nTerrible in that it not only explains each clan can put a gardener in a space, but\\nalso includes a photo example to be absolutely sure you get it?\\nI might have other complaints about the rulebook but this isn\\'t one.\\n\\nThis is one of the better rule books in the boardgame universe...\\n\\nI agree. I learned to play just using the rule book and watching one video play through. I find the rule book to be very clear!\\n\\nOh damn bgg told me to say something nice, hi Rob, how\\'s your view problem going ?\\nBest wishes <3\\n\\n\\n\\nIs it possible to get to the right side of the Passage of Time track?\\n\\nWe\\'ve played it a half dozen times and I don\\'t think anyone has ever gotten past 3VP. Specifically my last game no one scored any VP from it at all.\\n\\nIf that’s all you want to do! Not worth it VP-wise…\\n\\nMost we\\'ve gotten is the 6vp mark\\nMaybe only the first or second spot on that section\\n\\nYes, it is. I\\'ve done it a couple of times in 5 plays. But it depends on what cards are revealed at the start and throughout the course of the game. It also matters what bonuses appear on training yard tiles; also how many times you take the lantern bonus, and so on. The game is highly variable depending on what presents itself.\\nThat said, while getting far right on this track seems like the right thing to do, this isn\\'t necessarily the case. There is more potential for points in the garden and using the courtier/warrior combo.\\n\\nI got to 11 or 12 in my second game as I wanted to see what it would be like to really push it. It was not worth it, would have been much better off spending my effort on other stuff.\\n\\nI\\'ve also seen 10 and 11 in 20+ plays, but as others have said, better ways to spend your efforts. When you can get 20+ points in gardeners alone, why spend the effort. The only thing that track is good for is turn order. You don\\'t want to go last two turns in the game or you\\'ll have a hard time.\\n\\nEven 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 at the end of the track wouldn\\'t break the game. Three daimyo seals and four turn order steps for 4 vp (6->10) is not worth it considering the overall effort. I guess the turn order would be too important if the end of the track would actually be a valid option. I consider the points 10-15 more of a consolation price for poor play rather than something to aim for.\\n3vp or 6vp is something you should usually get. Anything above is usually the result of suboptimal play.\\n\\nI have some 20games in solo and yesterday was my 3rd 3-player-game with the same 3 people playing. (Their third game as well and they don\\'t own the game.)\\nIt definitely needs a certain board configuration.\\nIn our game, the 5-iron training yard has a 2-heron icon. One of the player managed to put 4 General in it and got to the end of the heron track.\\nI narrowly beat him by 2 points.\\nI don\\'t remember all the details but here are a few things I do remember.\\n- He started the game with Damiyo Seal in the Lantern bonus starting card.\\n- I led him 4 points in the VP track\\n- We were even at resource left.\\n- He led me 12 points in Passage of Time. He had 15, I was at 3.\\n- I led him 12 points in garden. He had 1 gardener and I had 3.\\n- I led him 2 points in the castle: He had 6-3-1, I had 6-3-3.\\n- In the training yard: he had 4x5, 0x3, 0x1. I had 1x5, 1x3, 1x1. so overall he led me 4 points.\\nHad he promoted one of his Courtier at the gate, it MAY have been his game. But it wasn\\'t definitive as what he received from the 2nd tier card may have been essential, but neither of us were sure that it was.\\nBut what I learned is\\n1) It IS possible to get to the end of the track\\n2) It IS viable to make that your main strategy, given of course you don\\'t sacrifice in other aspect too much\\n3) I tend to overvalue early Garden a tiny bit LOL.\\nRandom bonus tidbits that I remember:\\n- I think i drafted my starting cards wrong : P. But I was usually a bit uncomfortable with the starting cards that gives extra Lantern bonus. I value early growth too much. (probably wrongly so)\\n- I went 2nd, End-of-heron-track player was 1st player during set up.\\n- The last place player got denied garden bonus at year end first year. She first action garden\\'ed. (I semi-did that in purpose because I thought it was a dangerous move and probably to show her by example. It just so happened that I can use 3 coral dice just by myself.)\\n- Last place player was also only 2-3 points away from 2nd place. I speculate that had I not hinder her with the said move above She could\\'ve taken the game, too.\\n- I really Really admire and appreciate that he attempted the strategy so I can share it as a random single data point online.\\n\\nI made it to the 15 point space and won the game in a three player game one time, and it was one of my highest scoring games ever. However, I agree that most of the time, spending too much effort moving up the time track will hold you back from doing well. In the game where I made it to the end and won, I had the daimyo token lantern bonus card from the setup, and other stuff on the game board lined up in the right way to make it worth it.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it could ever be viable without the Lantern Seal starting card; the 3 Seal cost for the final barrier is incredibly prohibitive even if you collect enough Herons (usually via triggering Lantern actions off Courtiers). Even then, as others have said, it\\'s almost impossible to sink that many resources into it without giving up more points elsewhere.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it could ever be viable without the Lantern Seal starting card; the 3 Seal cost for the final barrier is incredibly prohibitive even if you collect enough Herons (usually via triggering Lantern actions off Courtiers). Even then, as others have said, it\\'s almost impossible to sink that many resources into it without giving up more points elsewhere.\\n\\nSo basically you need to have:\\n- Daimyo seal pump\\n- 5 iron spot: 2 heron + something great\\n- The Well has iron as a bonus resource\\n-Being in 1st or 2nd position in the setup and having 3 wild resources card on the board.\\nIt to leads to the fact that leaving the Daimyo token pump starting card to the 1st or 2nd position is usually a mistake in any case (and especially if the setup supports it) and this strategy shouldn\\'t work between highly skilled The White Castle players.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf there’s only one die can I decide from which of the sides take it out? So I get the reward\\n\\nNo. The one die will be on one or the other side of the bridge. You pick from there.\\n\\nYou always slide a die to replace the one on the right or the left when you take it. So there can\\'t be one die left in the middle of the bridge.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomvasel/support-the-di...\\nToo rich for my blood ($60 per pack; this is the Atom pack).

But my wife and my peer group are \"early-adopters\", I am slowly pushing them towards these more complicated, more complex board games. The dopamine kick that I (and probably all of you) get from these combo-wombos are extremely satisfying (Revive, The White Castle), I want mooooaaare. But the games of 60-120 min with the complexity level of what BGG recommends as \"similar games\" are rather too big, too complex, too heavy (like GWT or West Kingdom series). Thanks for your suggestions.\\n\\nIndeed the first game I thought of was\\n\\n, but it could be too heavy. Fun game though\\nIn the \\'very light\\' category there\\'s the\\n\\nseries which I can highly recommend.\\nCan\\'t think of similar games of White Castle complexity, sorry - look forward to other people\\'s input.\\n\\nIt\\'s not worker placement, but Tiletum offers the same combo-tastic thrill of White Castle in a medium weight game -- probably the same weight as Revive. It also has very few actions -- only 12 per game -- like the White Castle. The real meat of the game is trying to find combos and extending your turns.\\n\\nMaybe\\n\\n?\\n\\nActually, we already played \"That\\'s pretty clever\", it\\'s true that the combo-tastic feeling arises somewhat. But as an abstract game, the thrill is of lower intensity. I really like game with themes, even if the mechanics and the theme do not fully inter-link.\\nYes, you are right, it\\'s not only worker placement, it\\'s 1) dice drafting + placement and 2) worker placement.\\n\\nor\\n\\n.\\n\\nI also recommend Tiletum. As the poster mentioned previously, limited turns, dice drafting and combos but it plays very differently.\\nIn fact, I asked an almost obverse question to you - checking to see if Tiletum was different enough.\\nSo, yes it\\'s similar in regards to combos - lots of great plays to be made, but it is also a very different game in its own right\\n\\nIndeed the first game I thought of was\\n\\n, but it could be too heavy. Fun game though\\n\\nArchitects of the West Kingdom is ranked lighter than Paladins - indeed, lighter than TWC. It\\'s great. Can take 5, if that matters to you.\\n\\nFirst of all, I think The White Castle is just perfect.\\nAs you have mentioned, stone age is a good combination of worker placement and medium-light games.\\nThe first game I thought of was\\n\\n, but it takes time for 4 players.\\n\\nis the second.\\nFor the art of worker placement, I suggest\\n\\nif you can get a cheap one.\\n\\nFirst of all, I think The White Castle is just perfect.\\nAs you have mentioned, stone age is a good combination of worker placement and medium-light games.\\nThe first game I thought of was\\n\\n, but it takes time for 4 players.\\n\\nis the second.\\nFor the art of worker placement, I suggest\\n\\nif you can get a cheap one.\\n\\nOf course Arnak has deck building too! Right now these are my 1-2 most played games, with Arnak first…\\n\\nI would recommend\\n\\n. It also uses dice workers and had limited actions with some combos you can pull off. It is primarily an efficiency puzzle and gives very similar vibes.\\n\\nI really recommend\\n\\nDeus\\n\\nto you. There is no worker placement here but territory building. Deus is more an enginebuilding game than White Castle but the dopamine kick you felt on this last one I feel it too palying both games.\\nIn Deus, when you place a building on the map you trigger all the cards you have already played of the same building\\'s type. Triggering 4 or 5 cards in a row definitely give you the combo-wombos vibe.\\nAlso check\\n\\nOceans\\n\\n. It\\'s pure enginebuilding with hard combo-wombo effect.\\n\\nHadrians Wall is a combo-tastic game and even though it is a flip and write it is a resource management game but not exactly worker placed. It’s also a multiplayer solo but still good.\\n\\nA good one, with all the modules used is\\n\\nNot sure it fits since it\\'s not exactly a placement game (dice or worker), but have you ever considered Stefan Feld\\'s classic\\n\\n?\\nFrom a design standpoint, Trajan is a fairly unremarkable collection of six simple actions spaces, but what makes it pop is both its use of combos and the action selection mechanism. For this recommendation I\\'m focused more on the combo aspect: if we consider the six actions the letters A - F, then it\\'s quite common for your to select action B, which will trigger a bonus of doing action D, which then triggers action F. I say each action space is \"unremarkable,\" but this works in its favor (I mean they\\'re simplistic on their own, like \"take a tile\" or \"draw a card\"). It makes these chaining actions feel more rewarding, and given their simplicity, they don\\'t take up 10 minutes of playtime.\\nThe action selection mechanism is WAAAY smarter and more interesting than a dice draft, imho, but the mancala can be intimidating/frustrating to some. I\\'d also say the number of games that use this action selection mechanism could be counted on a sloth\\'s hand.\\nEdit: on the off you\\'re unaware of the action selection mechanism for this classic, here\\'s an image of the player board. The bowls with colored wooden bits are the mechanism. Main board is not in the image. The way you select your actions is to first select a bowl (say the one on the left with a \"9\" value tile above it), and then drop off pegs, one per bowl, in a clockwise manner. The bowl you end on is your action for the turn (III, directly opposite where we started). This can be a wild ride, especially for newbies. e.g. Action II above cannot be selected in the image above since no bowl has the right number to land there. Very smart game within a game.\\n\\np.s. Hmm.. lite, you say? That bit got away from me while typing the above. Trajan isn\\'t exactly lite, but it isn\\'t especially heavy either. Each element is fairly simple, but collectively you\\'re looking at Revive weight at a minimum (it wouldn\\'t be much heavier than Revive). Revive is weighted at 3.42, with Trajan at 3.64 for what that is worth.\\n\\nSince my last post was all about Trajan, I\\'ll put this into its own:\\n\\nis a decent dice placement euro that definitely clocks in at being a lite two player experience. No gushing here, but I think you might like it.\\n\\nhas you place dice to do actions and with action cards and the order of the actions, you can do a similar \"stacking\" of actions. The White Castle is better in this mechanic, but I immediately thought of AF when playing it.\\n\\nHow about from the same Designer, from the same gaming group,\\n\\nMaybe witchstone?\\n\\nThis game reminds me of\\n\\nCrown of Emara\\n\\nin some ways.

In many euros, you need to do some initial gathering of resources and infrastructure, then at some point “switch focus” and start making points off an engine. Here you need to just sprint right off; no warm up. You can’t simply do the exact same thing game to game given you take actions by dice drafting, and additionally, the initial setup randomizes actions/rewards in such a way a major element of the game is seeing best opportunities, and noticing when those change due to castle card actions getting changed when a player takes a card to switch out to their player board.\\nFurther attraction can be had if one likes the theming of the game, as the production is excellent quality, and in my house, it’s been well commented upon. It looks good, plays fast, rewards familiarity as there’s not a zillion actions like in Feast for Odin, but actual gameplay will alter due to the above factors.\\nThat said, some have been a bit disappointed at how short it is, and I can see for some the overall feel of games might be similar enough that it might feel played out over time. For me, it joins games like\\n\\n,\\n\\n, and\\n\\nthat pack a lot of game into a fairly short playtime.\\n\\nHello folks !\\nMore than 10 games since I bought it, I was thinking about if there is a game as good as The White Castle based on those criterias :\\n- Short game\\n- Elegant and simple mecanics with enough complexity to make it interesting to play\\n- NOT a table hog, fast to setup and teardown\\n- Good replayability\\nThank you all\\n\\nWAR CHEST!!!!\\n\\n+1 Elegant, simple, short.

Aber ja du ersetzt deine Start-Aktionskarte mit einer der drei beziehungsweise zwei Karten aus dem Schloss. Je nachdem wo dein Courtier geendet ist also ob du 2/5 Perlen ausgegeben hast.\\nDie Karten sind dann entweder dreigeteilt und du brauchst eins der 5 Embleme um die Aktion auszuführen und dann auch nur wenn der richtige Würfel auf deinem Tablet liegt oder eben zweigeteilt.

Basically, you always have an Action card on your board, and when you would gain a new one you replace your current one with the new one, and the replaced card goes in your lantern row. Does that make sense?\\n\\nThanks for reply. That makes sense.\\n\\nDanke, bestens erklärt.\\n\\nI add another question.\\nAfter you get the new card, you can perform the light side action from that card. If there are two light sided action, do I get it both or just one of them?\\n\\nHey, Rizal! You choose one of them.\\nIf your chosen action includes a Lantern, don\\'t forget that the card you\\'ve just added to the lantern row should be included in the bônus.\\n\\n\\n\\nHi! Interested by the game but I\\'m heavily wondering how the game hold up after a dozens of play? Is there enough variation possible to keep this interesting over the long term or not? Thanks to those who will answer. Have a good day!\\n\\nAlthough ive yet to play, (Holidays have been hectic) from reviews I\\'ve seen it sounds like it should have good replay ability, the random set up helps alot.\\nThe solo mode sounds like it\\'s the board game equivalent of Dark souls lol.  a lot of people say its unwinnable but i have heard of a few people beating it.  rather it be challenging than too easy and boring.\\n\\nI think the replayability is quite good.  The game can be very different from play to play as almost the entire setup is variable.  Sometimes I score 60+ points and others I feel like I\\'m lucky to get 30.  I do feel like there may be a preferred or dominant strategy, but it\\'s not always possible to pull it off.\\n\\nIn my opinion the game is very replayable. I\\'m ten plays in and still loving it! That\\'s eight solo plays (rules as written) and two four player games. The variation mainly comes in the setup. There is small variation in the garden setup (five left side and five right side cards and you use three of each for a game) but the dice tiles in the castle and the action tiles in the training yard all vary greatly from game to game. So, some games there will be tremendous synergy (between the castle dice tiles, garden actions placement rewards, and training yard actions) and other games will have more a struggle to get the resources and/or actions you feel you need. And with the mechanism that allows you to take and replace action cards in the castle combined with fresh dice rolls each round the game becomes an ever-shifting tactical efficiency puzzle - with tons of combos when planned correctly. If that appeals to you, I think you will find the game highly replayable.\\n\\nAlthough ive yet to play, (Holidays have been hectic) from reviews I\\'ve seen it sounds like it should have good replay ability, the random set up helps alot.\\nThe solo mode sounds like it\\'s the board game equivalent of Dark souls lol.  a lot of people say its unwinnable but i have heard of a few people beating it.  rather it be challenging than too easy and boring.\\n\\nTo build on this and semi-respond - I don\\'t think the solo is unwinnable. I had heard that from some of the content creators I follow. It may have caused me to not order it but I had already placed my pre-order. I\\'ve won four out of five easy games solo and one out of three medium games. I lost a medium difficulty game last night, 52-47. So, I genuinely don\\'t think it\\'s too hard.\\nMy nitpick would be moreso that the AI doesn\\'t respond to board state. So, while you as the solo player have a score ceiling depending on the setup the AI\\'s score is only dictated by its card pulls - pretty much ignoring the board state. There is a solo variant here on BGG (The Gingokawa Clan) that I have yet to try but it does sound like that variant might be a major improvement in this area.

It addresses one rather small issue the original bot had (going for double bonuses first) which in effect makes the bot harder.\\nAnyway.\\nThe real question is: is the game offering much replayability.\\nI really like(d) the game. I gave it a 8. So I am no hater. But the more I play it feels kind of samey.\\nIn the first round you try to get your gardeners out. Samurai and courtiers are prioticed in round 2&3.\\nHere it\\'s worth noting since there points are multiplied by each other you kind of going for roughly the same distribution of both of them. (5*5 is more than 4*6 or 3*7 ...)\\nSince the game is really tight on its nine moves you are forced to go for the best moves often dictating your strategy in the given round/turn.\\nI scored between 40 and 90 points. Mostly in the range of 60 to 70.\\nThe wide range of points comes mostly from the boards setup at start, the value of the dices and if you can get the \"bridge bonuses\" or not.\\nAll of this is completely irrelevant for the original/Gingokawa bot and therefore some games just don\\'t satisfy you because you know you lost or won independently of this bot....\\nTldr: you will play the game. You will enjoy it.

I don\\'t feel that the bot is too difficult so I don\\'t feel the need to make it easier.\\nAlso, I see what you\\'re saying about the samey-ness in the long-term strategy of getting your gardeners out early and then trying to equal the number of courtiers and soldiers to increase that multiplier. But I think the uniqueness of each game comes into play in seeing what actions/resources are available and how to most optimally and efficiently utilize those to achieve that long-term strategy. And sometimes the resources or dice (values) are just not there to allow you to do what you most want to do so you have to pivot and come up with a backup plan. I think those tactical adjustments make each game feel different and unique.\\nI am not arguing with you; just providing a counter-view for anyone trying to judge replayability. Some may feel that what I mentioned is not enough to make the replayability high and starts to feel samey early on with the overall strategy of placing your workers out. And that\\'s completely valid.\\n\\nA more winnable solo mode:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3210860/please-welcome-ging...\\n\\nMartin,\\nI think you find the game the same, because you play it the same. As for me: I do find very little gardens options the only minus. But the game is enjoyable in the way you play it: 1) I tried to win with gathering a lot of influence. 2) sometimes you won\\'t be able to put out the gardeners due to the lack of \"gardener\" action 3) playing with 2p and 3p is very different 4) introducing new people to the game is also enjoyable\\nSo for me this sounds like \"I do not enjoy this game because to win I need to play in a way that meets the winning conditions\" — well, that\\'s the \"flaw\" of any board game\\nbut the endless combo options, everchanging board situation, elegance of the game interconnection, and the joy of sharing this game with the new people makes the White Castle my favorite game of all time\\n\\nI\\'ve got 8 plays in the two months since purchasing this, and I find it to have high replayability, due to (in order):\\n1. The training yards (warrior) actions. With 9 double sided tiles, and only four \"sides\" in play each game, create a very different combo off of sending warriors.\\n2. How many (if any) of the steward level rooms have a double action available from a single die.\\n3. The 2 tiles selected into the well action, which defines the bonus stuff you get when you don\\'t have a lot else going on for you.\\n4. The gardens, that while not offering a ton of variability as you\\'re selecting 3 out of 5, offer some when combined with point (2) because some gardens will have a better action yield.\\n5. Daimyo cards. While there are a lot and only a single one is used each game, actually getting to the top with a courtier takes a lot of \"game effort\" that basing a strategy around that is negligible (in my opinion)\\nAll of the above have created games that felt different from one another, and with a very big diff in winning score, lowest being 40, highest being 82\\nAnd a side note, at 8 games totaling at about 14 hours of game time, it has a great value-for-money (purchased for 32 euro)\\n\\nDo You actually know how I play?\\nFirst: I really like the game. Really. I have around 20 plays. And as Dor Levi has put it: that\\'s really a good value-for-your-money.\\nAnd I also already stated: I gave the game a 8.\\nTherefore it\\'s on of my Top10 games so far.\\nSecond: I tried other tactics: influence/season track, flood courtiers. But just looking at the possible points: the influence track max at only 16 points needing 20(!) Steps & costing 6 seals.\\n5 gardeners can score you between 17 and 25/27 points...that\\'s a huge difference.\\nBut yes, i have to be honest: it feels samey because after trying and winning or losing with different tactics I am mostly going for \"my\" routine.\\nSo, just lets say we have a different opinion of this game...would I suggest people playing it? For sure! Would I say it\\'s one of the best value for your money. For absolutely sure!\\nWould I (and only me) say it has near endless replayability. Sorry no. But: not every game needs that. And for this price range it\\'s okay not to be a game for years.\\nI played it more than a lot of my other games. Costing way less (looking at you Bitoku).\\nSending\\nlove to all you fans and soon-to-be of this game\\n\\nIt’s short and sweet and the various cards and die tiles are different each game, and therefore so are your strategies. So it’s definitely highly replayable. Indeed (despite my reluctance to buy the game based on the criticism that it’s too short and impossible to win with the rules’ solo variant), I’ve found it to be addictive!\\n\\nDo You actually know how I play?\\nFirst: I really like the game.

But I assume, when your opponents has such a good Option and yours are only crap, you are already in a loosing Position.\\nHaven\\'t played yet, though.\\n\\nThe designer confirmed, that you don\\'t have to take the action of the dice, it is optional:\\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3166334/article/43217313#43...\\nThough with 9 actions per game, I rather try to make my own moves as efficient as possible than to block someone else\\'s actions imo\\n\\nI would say there is no way to really ruin a planned 27pts move\\nthe game gives you options\\n\\nThanks for the explanation  the last game we played we had this situation we were playing in 4 and my opponent had his last move and using it on the outside the walls action to remove the last option to put a gardner and i scored 60 points instead of 78 points because of that\\nwanted to check because it is strange to me for such a type of game\\n\\nIn 4p game you can put a die on top of another die, were you sure that there was no options for you on the whole table? That\\'s a pity\\n\\nit happens alot on the last round in the games we played until now\\nhappens it was just strange to me and wanted to make it clarified!\\n\\n\\n\\nFor extra credit - a breakdown of first time playing versus playtime for experienced players.\\n\\nSee\\n\\nthis\\n\\nrecent thread for replies to pretty much the exact same question\\n\\nSlow (very slow) thoughtful first time play 90 min.  Then it drops to about 80min with continued slow play.  The kind of play where no one is in a hurry and you can think through all your options.  I easily expect it to be an hour or less after having figured out the flow, typical strategies and how the initial choice of resource cards can define much of the rest of the game.  Some cards are open doors and other resource card choices will railroad you to a degree.\\n\\nThat’s totally out of the moon.\\nWe manage easily 25-30 mins. With big AP at the start for the best setup cards and board  analysis. Then you might rely on 1min per die.\\nWe have 20+ sessions under our belt and we love chatting and commenting each move.\\n\\n\\n\\nEach round, you may move a Clan Member of a different type (Warrior, Gardener, Courtier).\\nFor each type, there are multiple movement cards. During setup, randomly select one Warrior Movement Card, one Gardener Movement Card, and one Courtier Movement Card.\\nEach player gets three movement tokens, one for each Member type. You may play one token in each round, at any point during any of your turns, except in mid-action. When you play a token, take the action on the card for the corresponding Member type. If you do not play a token during a round, discard one token at the end of that round.\\nSample cards:\\no Warrior:\\n- Move to the next Training Yard \"up\". Take one action from that Yard.\\n- Move to the next Training Yard \"down\". Take one action from that Yard.\\no Gardner:\\n- Move to another Garden, paying or receiving the difference in food. Take the action for the new Garden.\\n- Move to a Garden of lesser (food) cost. Take the action.\\no Courtier:\\n- Move to another room on the same level (Steward or Diplomat). Take one of the light-background actions. Do not take the card.\\n- Move to a room on the next level down (Steward or Diplomat). Take the card as for Social Climbing.\\nNote that it doesn\\'t matter that some of these cards are better than others. Every player has access to the same Movement actions. It\\'s not a problem that you might prefer not to use a token; the \"use or not\" decision might be an interesting one.\\nIt\\'s a mini-expansion, perhaps a little too big to be Promo 3. It would require 12 tokens and 6 (or 9, or 12, or more cards, depending on how many cards for each type) cards. It would fit in the box!\\nWhat do you think?\\n\\nSo this obviates the need for dice? Or is an option to using the dice?\\n\\nThe dice would be used as normal. This variant provides extra things you can do.\\n\\nFor each type, there are multiple movement cards. During setup, randomly select one Warrior Movement Card, one Gardener Movement Card, and one Courtier Movement Card.\\n\\nInteresting.\\nWhat do you use as Warrior, Gardener and Courtier movement cards? Something from the box or some other card that does not come with the game?\\n\\nI\\'d use index cards or something like that.\\n\\nI\\'d use index cards or something like that.\\n\\nOr just do screenshots of each and then just print and sleeve them. Worked great, for example, dor the\\n\\nsolo variant cards.\\n\\nIf I were to take this to the game group, I\\'d print out my OP. I\\'d roll a die to choose which of the movement cards are in effect for this game, and mark that on the printout. As a player used a \"card\", I\\'d mark that on the printout.\\nTWC has been a hit at the group. No-one I\\'ve taught has suggested that it needs an expansion, or variant to increase the things you can do during a game.\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve played The White Castle a couple times now with three players. The first game was mis-played with five dice instead of the instructed four, and I found the mis-played dice count to be way more satisfying and fun.\\nThose extra three turns over the course of the game, while still significantly preventing you from doing everything you want, feel like a more complete play. Four dice, and the three turns less as a result, feels a bit empty and rushed. The final board state also feels incomplete.\\nI typically enjoy tight games and don’t usually like expansions, but in this case, I really feel the game ends too early with less turns. Thoughts?\\n\\nSome house rules for casual format are good to enjoy the games with your players. It is fun!\\nI have played several times with three players and four players. From my experience, three-player game is much more easier than four-player. And your \"rule\" simulates four-player game play and accumulate resources to three players.\\nOr to put it another way, which is similar, you play as four rounds instead of three.\\nYou may refer to this thread:\\n\\nYou can get more resources since you have 3 more extra turns. It is expected that you can place all the \"members\" on the main board with normal setup. It is complete but only determine the winner from \"passage of time\" points and extra clan points (lantern actions, castle actions or end-game resources)\\n\\nCongratulations! You\\'ve unlocked the same idea we all went through.\\nThe main point of this game is not to play more. But to do more with the limited number of turns. To find the combo, to build up. You will need to think more, but you will get the turns that get a meeple of each kind to the board and you will earn 80+ pts with the number of rounds designated by designers.\\nEnjoy the deeps of this game!\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the bot takes an outer die and there is a die in the middle of the bridge, that middle die gets moved to the outer spot on the bridge like in a multiplayer game? The rulebook doesn\\'t specifically say this in the solo rules, but probably assumes we know to do this for the AI bot too?\\n\\nYes, the die is moved to the outer spot.\\n\\nYes, the die is moved to the outer spot.\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\n\\n\\ni have yet to open my copy  but am looking at upgrading the coins,     from playthroughs online ive watched ive never seen the 5pt coins used,\\nwould ordering 50 metal coins of the same kind  be enough?\\n\\nYes, 5s are rarely used, each player would normally have not more than 12 coins\\n\\nAwesome  Thank you!\\n\\nEven more, I\\'d say that with 30, most of the time it should be enough\\n(taking the 5 value coin sometimes).\\n\\nnice,  at least i know i wont be short then\\n\\nUpgraded Scythe metal coins with really well with this.\\n\\nUpgraded Scythe metal coins with really well with this.\\n\\nI ended up ordering I ching coins from Amazon.   I could have sworn they are used in Japanese culture as well as Chinese to try to keep the theme matching,\\n\\nEtsy has upgrades coins that are identical in design to those that come with the game.\\n\\nif they are the same ones i seen  they are just I-ching coins,  just with a bigger mark up in price ( and a little pouch)\\n\\nCoins finally came in.  Also bought some koban coins.  Sadly koban are much bigger than i expected lol\\n\\n\\n\\nWhite Castle gives little cause for justified complaint, and much cause for praise. But there are always complaints, and I thought it might be interesting to consider some of them.\\nI think that there is one cause for justified complaint. I’ll get to that single thing first. Everything after that should provoke mild grumbles, at most.\\nThe sole cause for justified complaint is the Warrior Loop (which is not infinite). There are several threads about it; there is\\n\\nOne Thread to rule them all\\n\\n. Most of the posts start with a polite “Hey, this might be a problem”, rather than a rant. Some of them acknowledge that it is an edge case. I believe that it would be possible to play the game many times without encountering it.\\nThe designers have handled the Warrior Loop problem very well. Isra C has offered a simple rule change that fixes the problem (see the One Thread). There has been no attempt to deny or understate the problem.\\nThe most common complaint (it seems to me, I haven’t counted) is that the rulebook doesn’t include a list of components. It does include a QR code that links to an online list. I’d have preferred a page in the rulebook, but probably wouldn’t have referred to it after the first setup.\\nThe thing that annoys me the most is that the (English) rulebook could have used more editing. For example, on p. 3, the setup instructions refer to “Resource”: when it should be “Resources”. Once again, this is an irritation on first setting up the game, but probably not thereafter.\\nOne thing I’d like to have been made clearer is the Courtier action, for which there are 2 sub-actions. You’re not allowed to use the same sub-action twice; I wish that had been explicit.\\nSeveral people have complained that the solo mode is too hard. I haven’t tried it yet. If this is a problem, it is one that the community has addressed.\\nAnother complaint made multiple times is that the box is too small. The strong form of this complaint, that the game won’t fit in the box, is refuted by photos and videos. I myself like a compact, dense box, but perhaps I should add that I’ve yet to pack the game away.\\nThere is certainly a lot of game in the box, and for the price. There’s a lot of design, a lot of attractive components, and I have every reason to believe that there’s a lot of replayability. The box I received contained Promos 1 and 2; I’m not sure whether to thank Devir, the publisher, or Bordlandia, the online retailer, for that.\\nI highly recommend White Castle. If you get it, I recommend that you read the rulebook carefully. It is very well organized (although not well edited). Setup for the first game will be a bit laborious, but that’s a small sacrifice for a lot of variability in the game’s initial state.\\nPlease feel free to complain about (or otherwise comment on) this post.\\n\\nAnother small one but you cannot see the cards below the bridges depending on where you are sitting.\\n\\nGood job I\\'m too lazy to assemble the bridges!\\n\\nAnother small one but you cannot see the cards below the bridges depending on where you are sitting.\\n\\nThe bridges certainly have their pluses and minuses. TBF, initially I thought they were decorative fluff (like the Everdell tree). But was pleasantly surprised to find they are actually a functional part of gameplay.\\nI’m really perplexed by the many complaints about the box being too small. I’m tired of giant boxes of air and much happier to have a small, densely filled, box. FWIW, I have everything packed in the box just fine, bridges assembled. The dice are in a baggie. I could save even more room by storing them in their bridges.\\n\\nI just hate the fact so many rule clarifications are in the photos and their descriptions.  We are trying again tonight.\\n\\nI just hate the fact so many rule clarifications are in the photos and their descriptions.

Start playing at easy mode and see how it goes.\\n\\nI also enjoy the solo game, but did have to tweak the bot to make it more competitive. The main problem is that if you\\'re unlucky with card draws the bot can be taking multiple of it\\'s actions multiple times a round which can lead to scores most people are unable to achieve on a fairly regular basis. My tweak was that the bot only ever takes one action when it takes a die, but for each die it tries to take and isn\\'t able to (e.g. card says take middle red, but it isn\\'t available), the bot gets a number of points equal to the round (I was playing with them also getting a number of coins equal to the round as well, but generally don\\'t now).\\nNow there are definitely issues with this solo tweak: it becomes a lot easier to outpace the bot on the passage of time track, and it can end up with notably less workers out; but I\\'ve found the scores it achieves are much more similar to a regular players score range, and it feels much more competitive while also requiring minimal tweaking to the rules and components.\\n\\nThe original solo rules are functional if you wish to have a bot that takes dices and block spaces.\\nBut it\\'s not a fair rival if you aim to get more points than the bot.\\nSo imo is better to play \"beat your own score\" and dont bother with the bot score.\\nOr you can try the The Gingkogawa Clan variant for a more \"human\" bot\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is just a shout out to\\n\\nfor the excellent 3D insert he designed for The White Castle.

Featured it on my blog. Uploaded one picture here as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is our home variant to add automa as 3rd player. I hope it helps for those who would like to give a try.\\nGenerally it is all the same as the automa for solo play, with just few modifications.\\n1. When automa has to choose the die in middle of the bridge, if there were two dice there, just roll another die. Take the left one for 1-3 and take the right die for 4-6.\\n2. when automa\\'s courtier is leveling up to 1st floor, roll a die. He goes to the left one for 1-2, middle one for 3-4, and right one for 5-6.\\nWhen automa\\'s courtier climbs to 2nd floor, roll a die as well. He goes to the left room for 1-3 and right room for 4-6.\\n3. During end of round sequence, automa pays 3 dollars for points if his haron token is at the 1st place. Pay 4 dollars at 2nd place, and 5 dollars if he was behind.\\nI think that would cover all the ambiguity. We hope you can enjoy the variant as we do.\\n\\n\\n\\nI love The White Castle. It\\'s a such a well designed game.

Any chance of a printer friendly option without the background?\\n\\nMain issue, the bots actions are not bound to a given state of the board.\\nAny points by the bot, independently of being swingy or not, are in no way a marker for your own good or bad doing.\\nI am no good player, my points reach high up to 85ish but also low to 45ish. Heavily dependent on the setup, possible combos and generation of ressources.\\nThe two starting cards may have a huge impact in your given strategy, even so much that it (also) affects your endpoints as much as going first or second in a two/three player game.\\nYes, the lowest zone in the castle also can be really swingy depending wether There are double bonuses or not and ofc just the amount of red/white/black spots spread on the board.\\nHence TWC is a tableu/engine builder any bonuses for just/season aren\\'t as strong as ressources.\\nI really like TWC, but the more I play it the more I really can\\'t tell if someone won because he played well or because he just had a better fitting start than the rest.\\nLong story short: I don\\'t count the bots points anymore. I place the dies for blocking, don\\'t really take into account if the bot can score bonus points with his gardeners and mostly play game as a beat your own score while keeping in mind: some games are not possible to score more than 60 points normally.\\nFlame me now, the game is good but scorewise two players is kinda the best, followed by three players. Solo is meh. Four player is thrash for the one running last.\\n\\nBeing really picky now.... Any chance of a printer friendly option without the background?\\n\\nI can share in rough word type saved as pdf.\\n\\nThank you so much for this variant; I can\\'t wait to try it! Just yesterday, I was testing some new house rules to make the bot more balanced (at least on Easy level), and I came up with something: why shouldn\\'t it pay the difference in the value of the dice? It gains the difference if the value is higher than the printed one, but not paying (if the value is lower) results in a constant flow of coins that it never spends. And, in my opinion, that\\'s what unbalances the bot: the fact that at the end of the round, it can have 10-15-20 coins and convert them into points is quite punishing, especially in the last two rounds. I understand it\\'s a method the devs came out with to maintain a certain challenge on the seasons track, but the track still gives quite a few points in the advanced slots... so it\\'s in the player\\'s interest to consider it (or at least have it as one of the possible strategies).\\nI, therefore, thought of introducing this simple rule:\\nThe bot PAYS the difference in the value of the die EXACTLY as if it were a human opponent. If it doesn\\'t have enough coins to place an available die from the bridges, it simply cannot take that action. It earns 1 coin instead for every action or dice placement it cannot perform (not clan points, but 1 coin).\\nThe rule of converting coins into points at the end of the round remains (depending on the turn order), but this way, I found the cash flow to be more balanced and regular.\\nAlso, in my variant, the bot only performs the actions of the last revealed card.\\nOne small setup change depending on the difficulty level:\\nEasy --> Bot starts with 1 coin\\nMedium --> Bot starts with 2 coins\\nHard --> Bot starts with 3 coins\\nI\\'m attaching a photo of my last game: a very close victory, 50 to 47!\\nDo you think it can be implemented in your variant? Also, one question: does the bot gain 1 Influence and 1 Clan Point (playing on Easy) for all die placement options? Meaning, in order:\\n- a position in the card zone with 2 tiles matching the color die;\\n- the exact position shown in the card;\\n- the next available position in the zone;\\n- the well\\nThanks again\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

In fact, the setting of the famous Himeji Castle during the feudal era of Japan has very little bearing on the game, providing little beyond a patina of visual elegance. The framing does work, but some of the theme based iconography can be a bit to wrap your head around at first. The central mechanic of The White Castle is dice placement. During the three rounds of the game, three sets of different colors of dice are rolled and placed on the matching colored bridge in numerical order from lowest to highest. The amount of dice rolled is determined by the number of players, which guarantees that however many players there are, each one only gets three dice to place per round, leaving three dice on the bridges at the end of the round. Each player turn is determined by the color and number on the die placed, and different placements yield different bonuses, costs, worker placement action or a combination thereof.',\n",

The gardener action allows a player to place one of their gardener meeples on one of the six randomized garden cards placed near the bridges. This will always cost some amount of food (one of the three primary resources, counted on the player mat track, one for each area of the board), will trigger an action or grant resources, usually at an additional cost, and most importantly, scores additional points at the end of the game. If the final dice left at the end of a round are left in a space above an occupied garden, that player can activate the garden card’s ability again (Frankly, this didn’t happen as often as you might think). After several games of The White Castle at various player counts, it felt like this action was more situational than the other two, largely due to how expensive placing workers there could be. In games where the random setup elements provided for easy to acquire food and coin, they saw a lot more action. If food in particular was hard to come by, however, then those gardens were largely left untended.',\n",

Moving a courtier into that room lets the player claim it’s card and putting it in the card area on their player board (taking one action on the taken card for free), replacing the card that was there which now gets flipped over and added to the lantern action below (which is VERY good, more on that later).

The utility of these three spaces can vary from game to game depending on which ability tiles come out, but the real reason to empty your board of warriors is that they act as multipliers at the end of the game for the number of courtiers in the castle.

When a Personal Domain Action is taken, all of the revealed icons on the row yield the appropriate resources, and the action on the card at the end of the row is taken.

There are two different ways to trigger the Lantern Action, and you can trigger it multiple times in a single turn. The most obvious way to trigger it is by placing a die that corresponds to the action on a card or on the board. The interesting way to trigger it is by taking a die on the left side of the bridge, often requiring a sacrifice when placing the die due to paying the value difference in coin rather than gaining it like a higher value die would. Now, at the beginning of the game, this is more like a nice little bonus, but as you move courtiers up the castle and claim cards, your current personal domain action card flips over and moves down to an ever growing Lantern Action, bringing you everything from resources, to influence, to coins, to points.

              " 'The White Castle is the second game in a trilogy of historical titles by Devir Games, with The Red Cathedral being the first game. The game is for 1-4 players and can be played in an hour. The game is recommended for players 12 and older. The game is designed by Israel Cendrero and Sheila Santos. The game has a theme that focuses on Japan’s famous Himeji Castle, a landmark of Japanese architecture built in the 14th century and made famous by films like Ran and You Only Live Twice. Devir has been making great euro games lately and I have been more and more interested in what they keep on doing.',\n",

The game comes with 3 cardboard bridges that you will construct when first opening the game. Blocks are used to keep track of resources on player boards, and cards are used to change actions throughout the game.',\n",
              " 'How’s It Play?',\n",
              " 'Players will be taking turns choosing one of the dice on one of the three bridges to take actions with. The game consists of 3 rounds where players will take 3 turns in each round, so 9 turns total. When choosing a die to perform your action with, you can choose the higher value die of a certain color, or the lower valued die of a certain color. The color will determine what actions you can perform on the board, and how much money you will gain or possibly pay. So an orange die will activate orange actions and the difference between the selected die value and either the value shown on that spot printed on the board, or the die that has been placed already on that action spot.',\n",
              " 'When taking the lower valued die, you will pay the difference of values when placing it on a higher number spot to take its listed action. But unlike when taking the high value die, when you take the low number die you can activate your later reward which can get stronger and better as time in the game goes by.',\n",
              " 'Actions can give you resources like coins, daimyo seals, clan points, or one of the 3 resources that you track on your player board. Some actions require you to pay resources to take an action.',\n",
              " 'Dice can be placed to take actions in the castle, outside of the walls, the well, or the player’s personal domain. In the castle there are 5 different rooms you can visit, placing a die in those locations. Each location is a little different but might have one or even maybe two actions listed that match the same color of die that you use. This means, sometimes you can use a certain color die to take 2 actions instead of just one.',\n",
              " 'Actions done by placing a die outside the walls will let you take the action shown on either the left or the right, and this action is not restricted by color. The well can always be visited no matter what, and will let you gain resources, this way you can always do something on your turn.',\n",
              " 'The actions on your player board can be activated when placing a die, and you will take the shown resources. As you placed out certain type of clan members, you will be able to gain additional resources as those spots get uncovered.',\n",
              " 'Players are trying to get each type of clan member to a good place to score points by the end of the game. Usually when placing out clan members you might need to pay resources but you also might combo additional actions. Gardeners are placed out and you take the action where you decide to place it, and this action will possibly get reactivated at the end of the round.',\n",
              " 'Courtiers are trying to climb the social ranks inside the castle. The higher they get, the better actions and points will be scored. Courtiers will also change cards placed on castle sections and cause new actions to replace old ones.',\n",
              " 'Players will continue taking turns until all 3 actions have been performed. The round ends, and new turn order is determined by the distance players are on the passage of time track. Gardeners get reactivated, and die are rerolled for the next round. After 9 totals turns, the game ends and players score points. Coins and daimyo tokens turn into some points, points are awarded for how far you made it on the passage of time track. Lastly, each clan member is scored. The player with the most points, wins the game.',\n",
              " 'The Verdict',\n",
              " 'I like the choices in the game. First, your choosing one of the available dice, and choosing the lower valued dice will also let you activate your lantern reward, and then the higher valued die will let you earn more money when performing that action, so there is definitely pros and cons either way.',\n",
              " 'You then have a choice of several actions, some which depending on the color of die you choose can activate two actions. But other actions might help get you what you need to better position your clan members in better positions on the board. The game opens up with better actions as the game goes on, and possible combo actions where you can do something that will cause your clan member to move up and activate another action that activates another clan member.',\n",
              " 'The game is just nine turns, but when you place all the combo actions into the game, you can see how you can do so much more, especially in later turns. This is like a dream come true for those who don’t enjoy euro games because they are too long. You get the nice crunchy decisions, but in a faster game.',\n",
              " 'Each turn supplies you with either setting up for future turns, or with good decisions between so many available. But you will want to ultimately not ignore pushing your courtiers up in the castle spaces, as that’s a big way to gain points at the end of the game. In fact, your warriors don’t even score if you don’t have any courtiers inside the castle. And gardeners give you even more actions that trigger again at the end of the round.',\n",
              " 'Of course depending on how many players you have in the game that determines how many dice are rolled, sometimes a bad roll will leave payers will some less interesting decisions. In just 9 turns, you need to start producing some big actions at the very beginning of the game, don’t just wait until you have enough resources and then decide to trigger those big combo actions, start with it at the beginning of the game.',\n",
              " 'The game can get confusing as you are matching colors in different ways, and players can get confused thinking they are taking a certain action just to realize they have been scanning the board wrong and looking at actions they can’t even take that turn. After playing the game, you tend to figure out how colors match up, so this really is only a problem for newer players.',\n",
              " 'Overall, this is a very solid fast playing eurogame. You only have 9 total turns, so you will need to get going from the beginning of the game. The game provides lots of choices, and chance for combo moves to do multiple things in one turn. This is the second game in this trilogy and can’t wait to see what the 3rd game does.',\n",

              " 'there are three worker placement actions a die can activate, and each one represents an area of the board and a specific type of worker. the gardener action allows a player to place one of their gardener meeples on one of the six randomized garden cards placed near the bridges. this will always cost some amount of food (one of the three primary resources, counted on the player mat track, one for each area of the board), will trigger an action or grant resources, usually at an additional cost, and most importantly, scores additional points at the end of the game. if the final dice left at the end of a round are left in a space above an occupied garden, that player can activate the garden card’s ability again (frankly, this didn’t happen as often as you might think). after several games of the white castle at various player counts, it felt like this action was more situational than the other two, largely due to how expensive placing workers there could be. in games where the random setup elements provided for easy to acquire food and coin, they saw a lot more action. if food in particular was hard to come by, however, then those gardens were largely left untended.',\n",

              " 'i’ve already brought it up a few times, hinted at it, so let’s talk about one of my favorite parts of the game: the lantern action. there are two different ways to trigger the lantern action, and you can trigger it multiple times in a single turn. the most obvious way to trigger it is by placing a die that corresponds to the action on a card or on the board. the interesting way to trigger it is by taking a die on the left side of the bridge, often requiring a sacrifice when placing the die due to paying the value difference in coin rather than gaining it like a higher value die would. now, at the beginning of the game, this is more like a nice little bonus, but as you move courtiers up the castle and claim cards, your current personal domain action card flips over and moves down to an ever growing lantern action, bringing you everything from resources, to influence, to coins, to points. eventually you hit that one turn just right where you end up triggering the lantern two or three times and it’s like hitting a jackpot.',\n",

            "the white castle is a very tight game where every action has a large impact on your overall performance. you essentially only get 9 turns each game, so you want to try to do something useful with each and every one – and let me tell you, that’s not an easy task! in this game, all of the major mechanisms intertwine in a way that as you progress in one area, you gain some benefits towards the other actions – but of course, those actions require different resources than what you were collecting in in my opinion, white castle is all about advance planning over several turns to link actions together in the most efficient way. double castle actions only have value if they play into your strategy. if they don’t then they are a lost tempo and that will hurt your score. in general, if you have the most workers out, then you are going to be competitive for the win. \n"
