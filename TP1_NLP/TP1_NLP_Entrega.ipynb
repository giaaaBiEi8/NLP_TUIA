As an admiral, you command a vast and varied crew...but so do your rivals sailing other ships in the pirate fleet. Each day the fleet lands on a different island where you'll send a crew member to collect your share of the loot, hoping they'll return to boost your growing group of characters.\\n\\nLibertalia was originally released in 2012. Ten years later, Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest celebrates the foundations of the original design with a revised and expanded edition that includes all-new art, 40 characters per player, a reputation system to resolve ties, deluxe loot tokens, a robust solo mode, and much more.\\n\\n&mdash;description from the publisher\\n\\n\",\n          \"Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.\\n\\nThe initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:\\n\\n\\n    A cursed mask &ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.\\n    A golden mask &ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.\\n    A red torch or blue key &ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.\\n    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.\\n\\n\\nEscape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.\\n\\nThe real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.\\n\\nOnce the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.\\n\\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &quot;Curses&quot; module, some tiles &quot;curse&quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!\\n\\n\",\n          \"Verdant is a puzzly spatial card game for 1 to 5 players. You take on the role of a houseplant enthusiast trying to create the coziest interior space by collecting and arranging houseplants and other objects within your home. You must position your plants so that they are provided the most suitable light conditions and take care of them to create the most verdant collection.\\n\\nEach turn, you select an adjacent pair of a card and token, then use those items to build an ever-expanding tableau of cards that represents your home. You need to keep various objectives in mind as you attempt to increase plant verdancy by making spatial matches and using item tokens to take various nurture actions. You can also build your &quot;green thumb&quot; skills, which allows you to take additional actions to care for your plants and create the coziest space!\\n\\n&mdash;description from the designer\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"categories\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 697,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Novel-based']\",\n          \"['Transportation']\",\n          \"['City Building', 'Environmental']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"maxplayers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 100,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          6,\n          8\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

As an admiral, you command a vast and varied crew...but so do your rivals sailing other ships in the pirate fleet. Each day the fleet lands on a different island where you'll send a crew member to collect your share of the loot, hoping they'll return to boost your growing group of characters.\\n\\nLibertalia was originally released in 2012. Ten years later, Libertalia: Winds of Galecrest celebrates the foundations of the original design with a revised and expanded edition that includes all-new art, 40 characters per player, a reputation system to resolve ties, deluxe loot tokens, a robust solo mode, and much more.\\n\\n&mdash;description from the publisher\\n\\n\",\n          \"Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.\\n\\nThe initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:\\n\\n\\n    A cursed mask &ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.\\n    A golden mask &ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.\\n    A red torch or blue key &ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.\\n    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.\\n\\n\\nEscape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.\\n\\nThe real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.\\n\\nOnce the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.\\n\\nEscape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &quot;Curses&quot; module, some tiles &quot;curse&quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!\\n\\n\",\n          \"Verdant is a puzzly spatial card game for 1 to 5 players.

You must position your plants so that they are provided the most suitable light conditions and take care of them to create the most verdant collection.\\n\\nEach turn, you select an adjacent pair of a card and token, then use those items to build an ever-expanding tableau of cards that represents your home. You need to keep various objectives in mind as you attempt to increase plant verdancy by making spatial matches and using item tokens to take various nurture actions. You can also build your &quot;green thumb&quot; skills, which allows you to take additional actions to care for your plants and create the coziest space!\\n\\n&mdash;description from the

The book explores the crucial relationship between democracy and education, emphasizing that education is not merely a means of individual development but a vital process for the continuity and progression of society itself.  At the start of the book, Dewey discusses the foundational concept of education as an essential element of life, positing that education serves to bridge the gap between the immaturity of the young and the maturity of adults in society. He articulates that education is a mechanism of social continuity, facilitating the transmission of culture, beliefs, and skills necessary for the functioning of a community. Dewey argues that every individual is both a product of their environment and an active participant in it, shaping their experiences through interaction with others. This lays the groundwork for his exploration of how education shapes individuals in alignment with broader societal goals.

The work centers on the hero Aeneas, a Trojan prince who embarks on a tumultuous journey after the fall of Troy, aiming to reach Italy and fulfill his destiny as the founder of Rome. The narrative commences with themes of divine intervention, fate, and the struggles faced by Aeneas and his companions.  The opening of the poem introduces us to Aeneas, who is grappling with the loss of his homeland and the wrath of the goddess Juno. As he navigates treacherous seas filled with storms and dangers conjured by divine forces, the reader witnesses his poignant reflections on loss and longing for home. We encounter other significant figures, including the vengeful goddess Juno, who fears that Aeneas\\u2019s lineage will lead to the downfall of Carthage, and Aeolus, the king of the winds, who is manipulated by Juno to unleash chaos upon Aeneas's fleet. These initial verses lay the groundwork for the epic's exploration of heroism, destiny, and the interplay between mortals and the divine as Aeneas strives to establish a new beginning for his people in Italy.
